<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF HERBERT PUTNAM, ESQ., LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, the
origin of this bill is indicated in the message of the President to
Congress last December. The passage is brief; let me read it:
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in
definition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit
provision for many articles which, under modern reproductive
processes, are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon
the copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair
protection of the public; they are difficult for the courts to
interpret and impossible for the copyright office to administer
with satisfaction to the public. Attempts to improve them by
amendment have been frequent, no less than twelve acts for the
purpose having been passed since the Revised Statutes. To perfect
them by further amendment seems impracticable. A complete revision
of them is essential. Such a revision, to meet modern conditions,
has been found necessary in Germany, Austria, Sweden, and other
foreign countries, and bills embodying it are pending in England
and the Australian colonies. It has been urged here, and proposals
for a commission to undertake it have, from time to time, been
pressed upon the Congress.
</p>

<p>
The inconveniences of the present conditions being so great an
attempt to frame appropriate legislation has been made by the
Copyright Office, which has called conferences of the various
interests especially and practically concerned with the operation
of the copyright laws. It has secured from them suggestions as to
the changes necessary; it has added from its own experience and
investigation, and it has drafted a bill which embodies such of
these changes and additions as, after full discussion and expert
criticism, appeared to be sound and safe. In form this bill would
replace the existing insufficient and inconsistent laws by one
general copyright statute. It will be presented to the Congress at
the coming session. It deserves prompt consideration.
</p>
</div>
<p>
So far the message. It did not contain what was the fact as to the
origin of this project, that it did originate in an informal suggestion
on the part of the chairman of this committee.
</p>

<p>
The conferences to which it refers were not open, public meetings; they
were not conventions; they were conferences, and conferences of
organizations&mdash;that is to say, associations representing a group of
interests; and those organizations were specially invited, additions
being made to the list later as suggestions were made of others that
should be added.
</p>

<p>
The organizations selected were the most representative organizations
that we could think of or that were brought to our attention as having
practical concern in the amelioration of the law, but especially, of
course, those concerned in an affirmative way&mdash;that is to say, in the
protection of the right. They were nearly thirty in number. The list of
them and their representatives is before you.

</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. These men are the writers of books, the writers of
plays, the composers of music, the architects, painters and sculptors,
the photographers and photoengravers, the publishers of books,
newspapers, periodicals, music, and prints, and the manufacturers,
printers, typographers, and lithographers. The conference included,
therefore, those interests that abroad are considered primary in such a
matter&mdash;that is, the creators of the works which are to be protected
and the publishers through whom the property in these becomes effective
and remunerative; but it included under each of these genera several
species and various subsidiary interests. It included the National
Educational Association and the American Library Association as
representing to some extent the consumers; and in addition to the legal
counsel representing special interests it included two committees of
the American Bar Association and of the New York Bar Association of
experts upon copyright law, who gave gratuitous service as general
advisors to the conference and in the framing of the bill.
</p>

<p>
Upon questions of importation the conference had the benefit of
information and advice from a representative of the Treasury
Department, expert in the practice of that Department at ports of
entry. The Solicitor-General, whose name appears upon the list, was not
a formal participant, but his representative was present throughout as
an observer of the proceedings; and if I do not emphasize the aid which
he and which the Solicitor-General himself, in later informal criticism
and suggestion, rendered, it is only because the practice of his office
forbids him to take part in the initiation of legislation; and his
assistance in this matter must not be taken as a precedent to his
inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
The conference held three meetings in June and November of last year
and in March of this year, but, of course, as a conference it included
various minor consultations and much correspondence. At the outset of
the meeting last June each organization was invited to state the
respects in which it deemed the present law defective or injurious,
either to its own interest, or, in its opinion, to the general
interest. The second conference had before it a memorandum prepared by
the register embodying provisions deemed by the office important for
consideration at that stage. The third conference, in March of this
year, had before it a revision of this memorandum. The last conference,
this third, resulted in the draft of a bill, which was sent to each
participant for comment and suggestion, and the bill itself is before
you.
</p>

<p>
We would have no misunderstanding as to what this bill is. It is a bill
resulting from the conference, but it is not a conference bill; for the
conference did not draw it, nor did it by explicit vote or otherwise
determine its precise provisions. It is rather a copyright office bill.
The office submits it as embodying what, with the best counsel
available, including the conferences, it deems worthy of your
consideration, in accordance with your previously expressed desire. In
calling the conferences and in submitting the draft it has proceeded
upon your suggestion. Apart from the chapter relating to its own
administration, it has no direct interest in the bill, except its
general interest to secure a general amelioration of the law. It does
not offer the bill to you as the unanimous decision of a council of
experts, for it contains certain provisions as to which expert opinion
as well as substantial interest was divided. It does not offer to you
the bill as one that has passed the test of public discussion, for it
has only now come before the public. It knows already of objection to
certain of its provisions&mdash;objection which will be entitled to be heard
by your committee; and it is informed by one critic that his objections
are sufficient to cover fully one-half of the provisions of the bill.
</p>

<p>
The bill comes before you with precisely that presumption to which its
history entitles it&mdash;no less, but no more.
</p>

<p>
The conference had certain aids prepared in advance by the copyright
office, which were embraced in these particular publications, setting
forth the present law in this country and all previous enactments in
this country&mdash;a bibliography, indeed, of all bills introduced into
Congress, all amendments of the copyright laws, and the laws in foreign
countries so far as they could be epitomized.
</p>

<p>
The conferences occupied eleven days in all, of twenty-two
sessions&mdash;two sessions a day. Their labors are evidenced by these four
volumes, which are the stenographer's record of the proceedings. The
sincerity of their endeavor to secure a result that should be
scientific yet conservative, is, perhaps, evidenced by the brevity of
the bill. The memorandum of last November contains some 16,000 words;
that of March contains some 11,000 words; the bill contains slightly
over 8,000 words. I believe that the present group of statutes
embodying the existing law will contain somewhat over 4,000 words; and
they are alleged to be imperfect and neither systematic nor organic.
</p>

<p>
The bill attempts to be both. It is, as you see, divided into eight
chapters, with some supplementary miscellaneous provisions. I say that
it is divided into chapters&mdash;that is, recited in the contents of the
bill as printed officially and set forth in marginal references in the
bill as printed at the Library. These chapters deal with the nature and
extent of copyright, the subject-matter of copyright, who may obtain
copyright, how to secure it, the duration of it, the protection and the
transfer of copyright, and the copyright office.
</p>

<p>
I have furnished to your committee some analysis of it. That analysis
is contained in the printed statement marked "Memorandum," of which
there are additional copies here dated June 5, including those before
you, containing some slight changes from those sent out to members of
your committee. I would ask to have this one, dated on the outside June
5, considered the recent one.
</p>

<p>
(The memorandum above referred to was, by direction of the committee,
made a part of the record, and the same is as follows:)
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ctr">
MEMORANDUM.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
A.&mdash;<i>Some leading features.</i>
</p>

<p>
As the present law consists of but a group of statutes, and the
proposed bill is systematic and organic in form, the changes which
it introduces other than mere abrogations are not easily explained
by mere reference to the existing statutes. Throughout attempt has
been made to substitute general terms for particular
specifications, to provide for a protection as broad as the
Constitution contemplated, and to insure that no specification
shall tend to limit unduly either subject-matter or the protection.
Important respects in which the bill modifies or amplifies existing
law are as follows:
</p>

<p>
<i>Nature and extent.</i>&mdash;Section 1, like section 9, is
fundamental. The existing law (Rev. Stat., sec. 4952) specifies as
the exclusive right "the sole liberty of printing, reprinting,
publishing, completing, copying, executing, finishing, and
vending;" of public performance or representation; and of
dramatization or translation. The bill omits the specifications
"printing, reprinting, publishing, completing, executing, and
finishing," but attempts others intended to be fully as broad.
[Please see sec. 1.] It adds the right of oral delivery in the case
of lectures, and the right to make, sell, distribute, or let for
hire any device, etc., especially adapted to reproduce to the ear
any musical work, and to reproduce it to the ear by means of such a
device; but these latter are limited to works hereafter published
and copyrighted.
</p>

<p>
The copyright is to protect "all the copyrightable component parts
of the work copyrighted and any and all reproductions or copies
thereof in whatever form, style, or size."
</p>

<p>
<i>Subject-matter of copyright.</i>&mdash;A general statement that it is
to include "all the works of an author," leaving the term "author"
to be as broad as the Constitution intended. Certain specifications
follow, but coupled with the proviso that they shall not be held to
limit the subject-matter.
</p>

<p>
The specifications [sec. 5] substitute, so far as possible, general
terms for particulars. They omit, for instance, the terms
"engravings, cuts, lithographs, painting, chromo, statue, and
statuary." They assume, however, that these will be included under
the more general terms as "prints and pictorial illustrations," or
"reproductions of a work of art," or "works of art," or "models or
designs for works of art." The term "works of art" is deliberately
intended as a broader specification than "works of the fine arts"
in the present statute, with the idea that there is subject-matter
(e.g., of applied design, yet not within the province of design
patents) which may properly be entitled to protection under the
copyright law.
</p>

<p>
Express mention is made of oral lectures, sermons, and addresses;
periodicals, including newspapers; drawings and plastic works of a
scientific or technical character, and new matter contained in new
editions.
</p>

<p>
Labels and prints relating to articles of manufacture hereafter to
be registered in the copyright office instead of in the Patent
Office.
</p>

<p>
Additions, revisions, abridgments, dramatizations, translations,
etc., to be regarded as new works. [Sec. 6.]
</p>

<p>
<i>Who may obtain copyright.</i>&mdash;As broad as heretofore.
International reciprocal arrangements confirmed. The privilege
extended to any foreign author who is living in the United States
at the time of the making and first publication of his work, or
first or contemporaneously publishes here.
</p>

<p>
<i>How to secure copyright.</i>&mdash;The copyright is to be "secured"
by publication of the work with the notice affixed. This section,
9, with section 14, is fundamental. Sections 10, 11, and 13
prescribe subsequent procedure in the copyright office.
</p>

<p>
Registration is provided for works (e.g., works of art) of which
copies are not reproduced for sale, with the requirement that the
notice shall be affixed to the original "before publication
thereof." [Sec. 10.]
</p>

<p>
The deposit to be not later than thirty days after publication; in
the case of a periodical not later than ten days. The copies
deposited to be of the "best edition," as required by the act of
1870. [Sec. 11.] In case of error or omission to make the deposit
within the thirty days, permission to make it within a year after
first publication, but with the proviso that no action shall be
brought for infringement until it has been made. [Sec. 15.]
</p>

<p>
In case of a printed book the copies deposited must be accompanied
with the affidavit called for by House bill 13355, passed by the
House April 26, 1904, that the requirements as to American
typesetting, etc., have been complied with, and the affidavit is to
specify the place and the establishment in which the work was done.
</p>

<p>
Extends [sec. 13] the "manufacturing clause" to include texts
produced by lithographic process, and also in certain cases
illustrations and separate lithographs, but abrogates it in the
case of photographs.
</p>

<p>
The articles required to be deposited are to be entitled to free
transmittal through the mails, as under earlier statutes (e.g.,
act of February 18, 1867; July 8, 1870). [Sec. 12.]
</p>

<p>
The notice of copyright simplified. Specified only for the copies
"published or offered for sale in the United States." Where right
of public performance is reserved on musical compositions, a notice
to this effect is required. [Sec. 14.]
</p>

<p>
<i>Ad interim term</i> [<i>sec. 16</i>].&mdash;Extends the ad interim
term of protection in the case of books first published abroad in
foreign languages from one year to two years. Provides for an ad
interim term in the case of books first published abroad in
English, of thirty days, but with prohibition of importation during
the interim.
</p>

<p>
<i>Duration</i> [<i>sec. 18</i>].&mdash;Instead of the present term
(forty-two years), varying terms according to the subject-matter.
Provides a special term of twenty-eight years (instead of forty-two
years as now) for labels and prints heretofore registered in the
Patent Office; increases the term of other articles, and especially
derivative articles, from forty-two years to fifty years; and in
the case of original works increases the term to the life of the
author and fifty years. Abolishes renewals.
</p>

<p>
The bill also makes provision for the extension of subsisting
copyrights to agree with the term provided in the present bill
where the author is living or his widow or a child, provided the
publisher or other assignee joins in the application for such
extension. (See section 19 of the draft.)
</p>

<p>
The right of dramatization or translation must be exercised within
ten years or it will lapse.
</p>

<p>
<i>Protection of copyright.</i>&mdash;The present statute (Rev. Stat.,
sec. 4965) attempts to define acts which shall constitute
infringements. The bill, having defined the exclusive rights which
the copyright has secured to the author, defines (sec. 23)
infringement as "doing or causing to be done" without his consent
"any act the exclusive right to do or authorize which" is
"reserved" to him. It contains, however (sec. 22), the one
specification that "any reproduction" without his consent "of any
work or any material part of any work" in which copyright is
subsisting, shall be illegal and is prohibited.
</p>

<p>
The civil remedies open to him (sec. 23) are the injunction and an
action for damages and profits, or, in lieu of actual damages and
profits, "such damages as to the court shall appear just, to be
assessed" upon the basis of so much per copy or infringing act, but
to be not less than a total minimum of $250 and maximum of $5,000.
And the infringing copies are to include all copies made by the
defendant, and not merely those "found in his possession" or "sold
or exposed for sale." A provision for the impounding and
destruction of infringing copies and means for producing them.
</p>

<p>
Protection provided for [sec. 21] against publication or
reproduction of any unpublished copyrightable work.
</p>

<p>
A willful infringement for profit, now a misdemeanor in the case of
such a performance or representation of dramatic or musical
compositions, is made a misdemeanor in all cases, as is also the
insertion of a false notice of a copyright or the removal of a true
one. [Sec. 22.]
</p>

<p>
<i>Importations</i> [<i>secs. 26-29</i>].&mdash;Detailed provision for
the treatment of copies supposed to be infringing or otherwise
prohibited. Exceptions to prohibition modified as below under
memorandum "B."
</p>

<p>
<i>Suits</i> [<i>secs. 32, etc.</i>]&mdash;Actions may be instituted "in
the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in a
district where the violation of any provision of the act has
occurred."
</p>

<p>
Limitation of actions to be three years instead of two and to apply
to all actions under the act. [Sec. 34.]
</p>

<p>
<i>Transfers</i> [<i>secs. 37-45</i>].&mdash;Definitions of the
copyright as distinct from the property in the material object and
of the copyrights in derivative works as distinct among themselves.
</p>

<p>
<i>The copyright office.</i>&mdash;Sections 46 to 60 provide
specifically for the administration of this.
</p>

<p>
<i>Catalogue of title entries.</i>&mdash;Detailed provision is made for
the continuance of the printing of the catalogue on the allotment
for printing of the Library of Congress (see secs. 55 and 56 of the
draft); and the catalogue is to be made prima facie evidence of
deposit and registration.
</p>

<p>
Provision is made for the reprinting of the indexes and catalogues
in classes at stated intervals, with authority to destroy the
manuscript cards included in such printed volumes. The current
catalogues to be distributed from the copyright office, and sold at
a price fixed by the register; the subscriptions to be received by
the superintendent of public documents.
</p>

<p>
Following the provisions for the indexing and cataloguing of the
articles deposited, provisions are made, in sections 57, 58, and 59
of the draft for the public inspection of the copyright office
record books and deposits; for the permanent use of such deposited
articles; for their transfer to other Government libraries where
unnecessary to the Library of Congress; and for the disposal of
accumulations of useless articles.
</p>

<p>
Section 60 provides for fees. A uniform fee of $1 for registration;
but this is to include the certificate which is to be furnished in
all cases [a separate charge is now made for it]. And the
certificate is given a new importance as prima facie evidence of
the facts which it sets forth, including deposit and registration,
thus exempting the complainant in an action from other affirmative
proof of compliance with these formalities.
</p>

<p>
A single fee for certain registrations heretofore requiring
multiple fees.
</p>


<p class="ctrhead">
B.&mdash;<i>Provisions of existing law which are omitted from the
bill.</i>
</p>

<p>
The existing law is set forth in the twenty-odd pages of "Copyright
Office Bulletin No. 1." It consists of Article I, section 8, of the
Constitution, sections 4948 to 4970, inclusive, of the Revised
Statutes, and twelve later acts in amendment thereof. The
substantial provisions of these which are intentionally abrogated
are the following [references are to pages of the Bulletin, copy
herewith]:
</p>

<p>
[Section 4950, page 6.&mdash;Omitted in the bill, but exists still as
part of the act of February 19, 1897.]
</p>

<p>
Section 4952, page 6<i>A</i>.&mdash;Ad interim copyright. The
requirement for notice (of date of publication and reservation of
copyright) on the foreign edition is abolished.
</p>

<p>
Section 4952, page 7.&mdash;Labels and prints relating to articles of
manufacture no longer to be registered in the Patent Office, but in
the copyright office, with corresponding reduction of fee.
</p>

<p>
Section 4954, page 7.&mdash;Renewal term abolished.
</p>

<p>
Section 4956, page 8.&mdash;Requirement that the deposit of copies shall
be "on or before the date of publication" is abolished, and a
margin of thirty days is allowed, with provisions for making good
omissions within a year.
</p>

<p>
The deposit (registration) is no longer to be the act entitling to
a copyright. The copyright is to be "secured" by "the publication
of the work with the notice of copyright affixed," and dates from
such publication. Registration with deposit remains compulsory, and
after the expiration of the thirty days no action for infringement
can be brought until it has been made; but it is no longer
expressed as a formality the failure to comply with which is to
avoid the copyright.
</p>

<p>
Section 4956, page 8.&mdash;Preliminary deposit of title or description
abolished. "Photographs" omitted from the "manufacturing clause."
["Chromos" also, in terms, but assumed to be covered by
"lithographs."]
</p>

<p>
Section 4956, page 9.&mdash;Importation by individuals of the foreign
edition (two copies at any one time) is abolished except with the
assent of the American copyright proprietor, and the two copies at
a time are throughout reduced to one. The privilege of societies
and institutions (under the act of October 1, 1890) is no longer to
include the importation, without such assent, of "a foreign reprint
of a book by an American author copyrighted in the United States
unless copies of the American edition can not be supplied by the
American publisher or copyright proprietor;" and the society or
institution must be incorporated, unless it be a "college, academy,
school, or seminary of learning" or a "State school, college,
university, or free public library."
</p>

<p>
Section 4957, page 9.&mdash;The particular language of the entry in the
record books of the copyright office is no longer specified.
</p>

<p>
Section 4959, page 11.&mdash;Deposit of "subsequent editions" not
required unless the "changes" which they contain are "substantial"
enough to induce a new registration.
</p>

<p>
Section 4960, page 12.&mdash;Provisions of act of March 1, 1893, dropped
as no longer effective.
</p>

<p>
Section 4962, page 13.&mdash;<i>Notice.</i>&mdash;The date and the word "by"
no longer required in the notice. The abbreviation "Copr.," and in
certain cases the letter C within a circle, permissible instead of
the full word "Copyright."
</p>

<p>
Sections 4963, page 13; 4964, page 14; 4965, page 15; 4966, page
16.&mdash;Penalties imposed for acts in the nature of misdemeanors no
longer to be shared by the United States with "a person" suing for
them; sums recovered by way of compensation to the copyright
proprietor not to be shared by him with the United States. All
infringements willful and for profit made misdemeanors, and the
remedies provided by sections 4965 and 4966, including the
specifications of a definite sum for each infringing copy, etc.,
and a minimum and maximum total are expressed definitely as
compensation to the copyright proprietor rather than penalties.
</p>

<p>
Section 4964, page 14.&mdash;Witnesses not to be required for the
written consent of the copyright proprietor.
</p>

<p>
Act of March 3, 1891, page 18.&mdash;Only one fee to be required in case
of several volumes, or numbers or (in certain cases) parts of a
series deposited at the same time with a view to a single
registration.
</p>

<p>
Act of January 7, 1904, page 19.&mdash;Omitted as obsolete.
</p>
</div>

<p>
I have particularly noted in this memorandum the points in which the
bill intentionally abrogates existing law and the more significant
respects in which it modifies or amplifies it. The respects in which it
intentionally abrogates existing law are very few, as shown in Part B
of the memorandum. The phraseology of existing law is only here and
there recognizable in the bill. That is because the bill attempts to be
systematic and organic, and, second, because it has sought general
terms, wherever descriptive, rather than particular specifications.
Especially has it preferred this where the specifications might be
limiting. This, as I have noted in the memorandum submitted to you, is
particularly illustrated by the treatment of the "subject-matter." The
bill contains only the general statement that the subject-matter is to
include "all the works of an author," leaving the term "author" to be
as broad as the Constitution intended; and, as you know, the courts
have followed Congress in construing it to include the originator in
the broadest sense, just as they have held "writings," as used in the
Constitution, to include not merely literary but artistic productions.
</p>

<p>
After this general statement certain specifications follow in the bill
of particular classes under which a particular application is to be
made in the office, but these specifications are coupled with the
proviso that they shall not be held to limit the subject-matter. The
specifications so far as possible also substitute general terms for
particulars. They omit, for instance, the terms "engravings, cuts,
lithographs, painting, chromo, statues and statuary." They assume,
however, that all of these articles will be included under the more
general terms, as "prints and pictorial illustrations" or
"reproductions of a work of art" or "works of art" or "models or
designs for works of art." The term "works of art" is deliberately
intended as a broader specification than "works of the fine arts" in
the present statute with the idea that there is subject-matter (for
instance, of applied design, not yet within the province of design
patents), which may properly be entitled to protection under the
copyright law.
</p>

<p>
The attempt to substitute general terms for particulars is evidenced
also in the definition of the right, and of the acts which constitute
an infringement of the right. The present statute (sec. 4952) defines
the right to consist in the sole liberty to do certain things. The bill
(sec. 1) defines the right to be the sole and exclusive right to do
certain things, and it specifies those things; but its specifications
are in terms very different from those in the present statute.
</p>

<p>
The present statute (secs. 4965 and 4966) specifies certain acts which
are to be deemed an infringement. The bill, having defined the right of
the copyright proprietor as the exclusive right to do certain things,
defines an infringement to consist in the doing or causing to be done
without his consent of any of those things, the right to do or
authorize which is exclusively reserved to him. It contents itself with
this, adding only the one specification that "any reproduction,"
without his consent, "of any work or material part of any work in which
[his] copyright is subsisting," shall be an infringement.
</p>

<p>
So as to the person who may obtain copyright: The present statute
mentions the "author, inventor, designer, or proprietor," and elsewhere
the "originator." The bill rests with the term used in the
Constitution, "author," adding only "proprietor," which is not merely
in the existing statutes, but has been construed in a series of
judicial decisions.
</p>

<p>
Copyright consists of the exclusive right within a defined period to do
certain things with certain subject-matter and to prevent other people
from doing these things. The fundamental provisions of the copyright
law are therefore these four:
</p>

<p>
What is the subject-matter?
</p>

<p>
What are the acts?
</p>

<p>
How may the exclusive right to do them be secured?
</p>

<p>
And who may secure it?
</p>

<p>
Upon the third point, "How may the right be secured?" the bill modifies
substantially the existing requirements of law. These make deposit and
registration in the copyright office a condition precedent. They
require the deposit to be at least coincident with the publication, and
they stipulate that failure to comply precisely with this requirement
shall avoid the copyright ab initio.
</p>

<p>
The bill, in section 9, initiates the copyright from the date of the
publication of the work, with the notice of copyright affixed. So, in
effect, does the present law initiate the copyright from that date,
provided the deposit and registration be effected then; but by the bill
the publication with notice not merely initiates the copyright, it
"secures" it. That is the expression used in the bill.
</p>

<p>
Deposit and registration in the copyright office are still requisite,
but a reasonable period after publication is allowed for them. The
period is thirty days, and in the case of error or omission may be even
an entire year, but with the proviso that after the thirty days no
action for infringement may be brought until these requirements have
been complied with. The right is to be exclusive for a limited period.
This period is now twenty-eight years, with a possible renewal for
fourteen years&mdash;a maximum, therefore, of forty-two years. The bill
abolishes renewals and provides for three terms, according to the
subject-matter. The shortest is twenty-eight years for labels and
prints relating to articles of manufacture heretofore registered in the
Patent Office, but which the bill proposes to be taken over into the
copyright office. The second term, fifty years, is substantially
identical with the present possible maximum of forty-two. It applies to
some original and to all derivative works. It would probably cover the
majority of copyright entries during any particular period&mdash;the
majority in number, I do not say in importance. The longer term&mdash;the
life of the author and fifty years after his death&mdash;applies only to
original works, but applies to most of those.
</p>

<p>
As to the merit of these terms, Mr. Chairman, and their necessity you
will hear discussion. I merely call your attention to them with,
however, these suggestions, which I feel in duty bound to communicate,
because they have been so insistently urged upon us:
</p>

<p>
First, that the present term, a maximum of forty-two years (and that a
conditional maximum), does not insure to the author his copyright even
throughout his own life, and it makes no certain provision for his
immediate family after his death. These are admittedly grave defects,
and they are perhaps not met by the fact&mdash;it is a fact&mdash;that at present
the privilege of renewal is taken advantage of by only a small
percentage of the authors or their families.
</p>

<p>
The second is, that a term as long as life and fifty years exists in
fifteen countries, including France; that England, with the minimum
term of life and seven years proposes a term of life and thirty years,
and that Germany, with a term of life and thirty years, is
discussing&mdash;informally thus far, but is discussing a term of life and
fifty years.
</p>

<p>
The third suggestion is that a common disposition to question a long
term for copyright, on the ground that a short term suffices for
patents, is based upon false analogy. Literary and artistic productions
and useful inventions may be equally the creations of the mind, and
they are coupled in the Constitution; but they are coupled, it is
pointed out, only as deserving protection. Their character, and the
duration of the protection required by each, may be very different. It
is alleged to be very different. The monopoly is different; the returns
to the creator are different, and the interests of the public are
different in the two cases. The monopoly by patent in an invention is a
complete monopoly of the idea. The monopoly by copyright in a literary
or artistic work is a monopoly merely of the particular expression of
the idea. The inventor's exclusive control of his idea, it is said, may
bar innumerable other inventions, applications of his idea, of
importance to the public, while the author's or artist's exclusive
control of his particular expression bars no one except the mere
reproducer. The returns to an inventor are apt to be quick; the returns
to an author are apt to be slow, and the slower in proportion to the
serious character of his book, if a book. The returns to a successful
inventor are apt to be large; the returns to even a successful author
or artist are not apt to be more than moderate.
</p>

<p>
Then the idea, it is said, covered by an invention or discovery, may
concern the essential welfare, even the lives, of the community, and
should be freely available at the earliest possible moment not unjust
to the creator of it. Now, it is remarked that no particular book, at
least none currently copyrighted to-day, can be said to be essential to
the welfare or protection of the community. Many a man's pleasure may
be enhanced by it, some men's profit; but no man's essential welfare
depends upon it, and no man's life, save, perhaps, the author's own.
</p>

<p>
I communicate those suggestions as having been pressed upon us.
</p>

<p>
In no respect are the present statutes alleged to be less satisfactory
than in their provisions for the protection of the right, and redress
to the copyright proprietor for invasion of it. One inconvenience is
that they provide a different class of remedies and recoveries for
different subject-matter; another is that they seem to confuse the duty
of the Government to punish a deliberate infringement as it would
punish any other theft with the right of the copyright proprietor for
compensation for his particular losses. The bill attempts to provide
uniform remedies, and it divorces the civil action from the criminal.
As the memorandum states it, "Penalties imposed for acts in the nature
of misdemeanors are no longer to be shared by the United States with a
person suing for them;" nor "are sums recovered by way of compensation
to the copyright proprietor to be shared by him with the United
States." Nor is his right to recover such sums to be imperiled by the
necessity of proving that the defendant has committed an offense
against the community as well as profited at his expense.
</p>

<p>
The deliberate theft of a dramatic or musical composition by the
willful performance of it for profit, without the assent of the owner,
author, or copyright proprietor, is now by law a misdemeanor. The
conference could not see why this provision should not apply to any
infringement which is both willful and for profit, and section 25 of
the bill extends it to all such.
</p>

<p>
The existing provision (sec. 4966, Rev. Stat.) which provides remedies
and penalties for infringement of dramatic and musical copyrights, is
of great moment to the dramatists and composers; and now that it is
merged in the general provisions of this and other sections of the bill
they are in great apprehension lest it may suffer accident, if accident
befall these. To guard against this the general repealing clause of the
bill excepts and continues in force section 4966 of the Revised
Statutes, but it does so with the intention that this exception shall
be dropped in case the general provisions stand.
</p>

<p>
The reason or merit of these and other provisions of the bill will at
the proper time have to be made clear to you, if challenged. That is
no part of my present duty, which is merely to introduce the bill to
your attention, with some explanation as to how it came to be, and
some note as to its leading features. But I except two matters, and I
do so to avoid misapprehension; and I feel free to do so because both
involve the administration of the copyright office. One is as to
fees. The impression has gone out that the fee for registration is to
be doubled. The fee for registration is now 50 cents, but 50 cents
additional is charged for a certificate when furnished. The proposed
fee is $1, but this is to include the certificate, which is to be
furnished in all cases and as a matter of course. It ought to be
furnished, in the opinion of the office, and no claimant of copyright
ought to rest easy without it. It is the evidence of registration and
deposit&mdash;indispensable formalities, even hereafter&mdash;and it is now to
be prima facie evidence in a court of law of the facts which it sets
forth.
</p>

<p>
If the copyright is worth the 50 cents for the registration, it seems
certainly worth the additional 50 cents for the certificate. But I note
here that objections are to be raised to the provision for fees, and
particularly as working hardships in some cases not made exceptions, as
the case of a series of studio photographs registered under one title
at the same time is made an exception. You will have some suggestions
as to cases in which the exaction of this fee, without some special
modification in certain cases, would work an undue hardship.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the bill tends to reduce the aggregate fees payable
by any one publisher and the aggregate receipts of the office by
enabling a number of volumes of the same work, and in the case of
photographs, prints, and like articles, an entire series, if registered
at the same time, to be registered for a single fee.
</p>

<p>
The other matter is that of copyright deposits. The volume of these is
now prodigious. During the last year alone the articles deposited
exceeded 200,000 in number. A large proportion of these are of great
value to the Library and are drawn up into it. The rest remain in the
cellar. The accumulations in the cellar now number a million and a half
items. Many of these would be useful in other Government libraries; for
instance, medical books in the library of the Surgeon-General's Office.
Some of them might be useful in exchange with other libraries. A few
might have value in exchange with dealers. The remainder are a heavy
charge upon the Government for storage and care, without any
corresponding benefit. They ought to be returned to the copyright
proprietors if they want them, or, if not wanted, destroyed. Such
dispositions are, I believe, already within the authority of law; but
it is fair that they should be expressed. The bill (secs. 58 and 59)
definitely expresses them. I ask your attention to them in due course.
They have been accepted by the conferences, and therefore by the
interests outside of the Government most nearly concerned with their
operation. But they may awaken some apprehension elsewhere because of a
quite common misunderstanding of the significance of the deposit and
its relation to the copyright protection.
</p>

<p>
The original purpose of such deposits was the enrichment of the
Library. This is clear from their history, both in this country and
abroad. They were made a condition of securing copyright, but they had
no continuing relation to the copyright once secured. In England, for
instance, the copies required (now five) are to be for the use of the
libraries&mdash;five libraries&mdash;no one of which is the office of
registration for copyrights. The earliest act in this country was that
of Massachusetts, in 1783, which exacted a copy as a gift to the
library of the University of Cambridge, Harvard University, "for the
use of said university," which was not the office of copyright. The
earliest act providing for deposit in the Library of Congress, that of
1846, provided that the copyright proprietor should give one copy of
the book to this Library, and at the same time it provided that he
should give one copy to the library of the Smithsonian for the use of
that library.
</p>

<p>
In 1867 the library of the Smithsonian became a part of the Library of
Congress. The act of 1870 provided two copies, both to be addressed to
the Library of Congress. But by that same act of 1870 the Library of
Congress became the office of registration for copyright; and from that
time, and because the failure to deposit not later than the date of
publication actually voided the copyright, an impression has grown up
that the articles deposited are an integral part of the record of
registration, and have a peculiar sanctity as such. The fact of the
deposit has been and will be an integral part of the record, and in
times past this could most readily be proved by the copies themselves,
the law providing neither for a certificate to the claimant admitting
the receipt of the deposit nor an entry in the official record showing
it. But hereafter the fact of deposit will be proved by the certificate
itself.
</p>

<p>
There is an impression&mdash;a very natural one, too&mdash;that the copies
deposited are necessary evidence of the thing copyrighted, and
essential as such in litigation. Now, during the past thirty-six years
the copyright office has record or memory of only four cases in which
articles deposited have been summoned into court, and an authority on
copyright litigations remarks that in three of these he is quite
certain that the reason was a fanciful one, and in the fourth he did
not see any necessity for it.
</p>

<p>
For the matter of that, however, there is little prospect that any
article of sufficient importance to be a subject of litigation would be
deliberately destroyed, or would fail to be drawn into the permanent
collections of the Library&mdash;at least one copy of it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman, having indicated something of what the bill is, let me
say a word as to what it is not, in intention.
</p>

<p>
First. It is not an attempt to codify the common law. The conservative
bar was very fearful that it would be. Even more than the present
statutes, it leaves to the courts to determine the meaning and extent
of terms already construed by the courts. It does this even in cases
where the temptation to define was considerable and where foreign
statutes attempt a definition. For instance, Who is an author? What is
publication in the case of works not reproduced in copies for sale?
What is fair use? Now, many such definitions were proposed and
lengthily discussed, and omitted because they did not stand the test of
the best expert opinion of the most conservative advisers of the
conference, particularly the committees of the bar associations.
</p>

<p>
Second. The bill does not, in intention, attempt to regulate relations
between authors and publishers which are or may be matter of private
contract.
</p>

<p>
Third. It is not an attempt at abstract and theoretic perfection, nor
is it an attempt to transplant to this country theoretic or what might
be charged to be sentimental provisions of foreign law. It tries to be
a bill possible for this country at this time and under conditions
local here. It contains, therefore, some provisions which are, in our
judgment, neither theoretically sound nor according to modern usage
abroad nor satisfactory to particular participants in the conference.
These are a compromise between principle and expediency or between one
interest and another at the conference, between which we could not
decide for either extreme&mdash;I mean decide in the sense of bringing
before you a suggestion in this particular form. We had not any
decision in any other sense; we were not a commission. The bill is a
compromise. I doubt if there is a single participant in the conferences
whom it satisfies in every particular.
</p>

<p>
Fourth&mdash;and I feel really, Mr. Chairman, in justice to the conferences,
after their year of labor, impelled to say this&mdash;the bill is not a mere
congeries of provisions proposed by a selfish group, each member of
which was considering solely his own particular interest. It contains,
of course, some provisions which concern only particular interests&mdash;for
instance, the provision as to sound records, or that as to affidavit of
domestic manufacturers. But these are easily distinguishable; we
suppose and we should hope that they would be distinguished, and
particularly so if, as we know to be true in the case of sound records,
there is to be definite objection before you against the bill as it
stands; and we should hope that that objection, with the arguments of
those with whom the proposal originated particularly, should be set
aside for special discussion distinct from the general discussion on
the bill as a whole. I say there are provisions which concern
particular interests, of course, particularly; but these we should hope
would be distinguished in your consideration of it.
</p>

<p>
The bill is the result of a sincere attempt, as we have seen it, to
frame a reasonable general statute. I say "sincere," and I feel the
right to say it because I followed the conferences closely, and had the
best opportunity to judge of their temper and disposition. If some of
the interests were selfish in one direction, they were met by the
selfishness of others in another direction, and both were under
criticism from the general advisors and under the influence of the main
body. And neither such interests&mdash;and I am speaking of history now, of
course&mdash;neither such interests nor any other participant in the
conference initiated the conference, nor determined its composition,
nor controlled its proceedings. The conference was initiated by the
Copyright Office at your suggestion, Mr. Chairman. It was composed of
organizations invited by the office, and it was theoretically held in
the office. The Librarian presided at it, and except for the purpose of
some formal resolutions it never organized or in any other way passed
out of the control of the office.
</p>

<p>
If the bill reveals some selfishness, it is perhaps condonable. It is
the selfishness of men trying to protect their own property; for of
course, as I have emphasized, the interests that were especially
invited to the conferences were those that are concerned in an
affirmative way with the protection of the right. The conferences were
not generally representative&mdash;completely representative&mdash;in other
respects. The bill has that purpose&mdash;that is, for the protection
particularly of the property. It comes before you for consideration on
the ground that it goes too far. It does not create, of course, a new
species of property; it merely recognizes a species of property created
by the Constitution and already recognized by statute. Its purpose is
simply to secure to the man who has created it a species of property
which peculiarly requires the protection of law, because the very act
which makes it remunerative to him lays it open to expropriation&mdash;that
is, the act of publication&mdash;and seems peculiarly entitled to the
protection of the law, because it is that act, and that alone, which
makes it of any use to the public; and of course it secures this
protection&mdash;not permanently, but only against untimely expropriation.
</p>

<p>
It may be said that the public was not represented at the conferences.
The public in this matter would, I suppose, belong to one of four
classes: In the first place, the producer, the creator, with his
publisher and manufacturer; or, second, one who is to enjoy the work as
a consumer; or, third, one who wishes to utilize the work in some other
work, or to reproduce and market it for his own benefit, when this can
be done innocently; or, fourth, the student and critic of the rights
and obligations of property, and of the regulation of this by law.
There may be a fifth class, the mere pirate. He was not invited to the
conferences, and I suppose he would not be to your hearings. But the
innocent reproducer was not unrepresented at the conferences or in the
discussions. In fact, most of the producers were also reproducers, and
quite insistent upon their convenience as such. The original producers,
publishers, and manufacturers were there as of right, and the student
and critic through their interest and public spirit. As for the
consumers, two considerable groups were actually represented, and more
would have been if organizations could have been found to represent
them. Others also there spoke for them.
</p>

<p>
But as I understand it, it is in the interest of the consumer just
because it is in the interest of the producer that copyright laws were
originally designed and were called for by the Constitution; and if
this proposed one fails fairly to regard that interest of the consumer,
its defects will surely be brought to your attention by the third great
estate which is jealous of those interests&mdash;the newspaper and
periodical press; for the bill is now before the public.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Mr. Chairman, notwithstanding the labor put upon it, the bill
is doubtless still imperfect in expressing its intentions; and I have
no doubt that while it is under consideration those especially
concerned will ask leave to submit to you some amendments of
phraseology. I understand that any such amendments proposed by
participants in the conferences will be communicated first to the
copyright office, so that they may be formulated by the register for
your convenient consideration; and the office will gladly do the same
for any that may reach it from any other source.
</p>

<p>
The relation of the office to this project has been peculiar, Mr.
Chairman, and that alone has excused me in introducing the bill to you.
But having introduced it, the office will, with your permission,
relapse into its more normal position of informant to your committee on
matters of fact, and an adviser when its opinion is asked. With the
general structure of the bill, including its phraseology, the office
will of course have especial concern. Upon the general principles
involved and upon matters of practice the office will naturally have
some opinions, and may not avoid ultimately expressing these, even
though in doing so it incidentally supports a provision which concerns
particularly a particular interest. It can not avoid this where a bill
is referred to it by your committee for its opinion, and still less can
it do it in the present case where it is itself in possession of the
reasons which induce the various provisions and the principles supposed
to underlie them. It must, as occasion requires and you think
necessary, expound the bill. Mere advocacy, however, Mr. Chairman, of
any particular provisions it must leave to others.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman, ordinarily I assume that in such a case as this those who
are in a sense proponents of the measure would be heard in the
affirmative in argument in support of the measure. It is my
understanding that in so far as the proponents can be said to be those
who participated in the conferences, they do not care for leave to make
any argument as such. Certain of them, representing typical interests,
would, however, be glad to submit a word or two in behalf of those
interests&mdash;a very brief word, no one of them speaking for more than
five minutes. We have thus far (which I am under duty to communicate to
you) notice of objections to two or three particular provisions and
then to the bill substantially as a whole.
</p>

<p>
One of the particular provisions is that against reproduction of
copyrighted musical compositions by means of some device or appliance
for reproducing it to the ear. Another particular provision is that
which, in two respects, curtails the privilege of American libraries to
import foreign editions of works copyrighted here.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It does so in more than two respects, does it
not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. The present law permits two; the bill cuts the two
to one.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Yes; but there are various other restrictions
embodied in the bill, are there not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. In regard to libraries?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. In regard to importation for libraries.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Yes; there may be other points. I was speaking of
the two.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. The individuals are cut out, are they not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. The individuals are cut out.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That is one restriction.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. They are noted as cut out.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. The number of books is reduced from two to one?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. In all cases; yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Then the phraseology is so changed that it must
mean something. When you say, "To any book published abroad," beginning
on page 16, "with the authorization of the author or copyright
proprietor," what does that mean?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Page 16 of the library print?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Yes; it is subdivision E, page 16.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Section 30&mdash;"any book published abroad with the
authorization of the copyright proprietor"&mdash;that is, the authorized
foreign edition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Well, that phraseology is new.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I was not of the impression that the intent was
new in that. It refers to the foreign authorized edition as
distinguished from the foreign unauthorized edition, because the
importation of any unauthorized edition is prohibited as a fraudulent
invasion of the right. It may be, of course. If there is any diminution
under that of the present privileges of libraries, there is a group of
librarians who desire to be heard. I do not know that they had that so
particularly in mind as the exception under subsection 3.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. In subsection 3 there is still another new
restriction, is there not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. As to the privilege of importation without the
consent of the American copyright proprietor, etc.?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That is still another restriction?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Yes; two copies reduced to one, this prohibition
of the importation of the foreign edition of a book of an American
author published here of which there is an authorized American
edition&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. And the cutting out of the right of the
individual?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. And the cutting out of the right of the
individual. I was speaking of libraries first; yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. And then such restrictions as may be embodied in
that phraseology?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Yes; if there is any restriction there, that also.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I understood some two months ago that an
agreement had been reached between the publishers and the librarians,
satisfactory to both, which was to be embodied in the bill. Was that
the proposition that is now a part of the bill?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I think that can best be answered, Mr. Currier, by
Mr. Bostwick, who is here, who was a participant in the conferences in
behalf of the American Library Association. That is the general
association of this country. Mr. Bostwick and Mr. Hill were the two
delegates to the meeting; and Mr. Bostwick will say whether this
provision is satisfactory to his association as an association.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I simply desire to say that my mail is filled
with protests from librarians and from universities and colleges
against this restriction.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Yes; and as I was saying, Mr. Currier, we have
already note of that protest. Mr. Cutter, Doctor Steiner, and perhaps
others&mdash;certainly those two, however&mdash;Mr. Cutter being librarian of the
Forbes Library, at Northampton, and Doctor Steiner being librarian of
the Enoch Pratt Library, at Baltimore, are here in behalf of
remonstrants against any diminution of the present privileges of
libraries. I had understood that this provision as it stands had been
accepted by the representatives of the association simply as
participants in the conference. May Mr. Bostwick state as to that, Mr.
Chairman? I only suggest it because you asked the question.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We have concluded that it is best to adopt the
suggestion to hear first the proponents of the bill and then, at a
later period, hear those who object to its provisions.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. In that case, Mr. Chairman, if you will let me
suggest, the interests represented at the conference are easily
classifiable. They were the creators of literary productions, the
authors; they were the dramatists; they were the composers and the
publishers of those productions, the manufacturers, the reproducers;
they were these two associations, so far as we had them there,
representing the consumers; and then there were the two committees of
the American Bar Association representing our general legal advisers.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bowker is here representing the author class particularly.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We will hear from Mr. Bowker.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like to have it noted on the
record that I have received a letter from former Judge A. J.
Dittenhoefer, the well-known lawyer of New York City, who represents
the American Dramatists' Club and the Managers' Association, of New
York, and who desires to appear at some subsequent time in favor of
certain provisions in this proposed law.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Does he desire to be heard if the committee is
in favor of them?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. No; not if the committee is in favor of them. That
is the point.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Perhaps that can be taken up, then, at a later
date.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Yes.

STATEMENT OF RICHARD ROGERS BOWKER, ESQ., VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE
AMERICAN COPYRIGHT LEAGUE.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Will you please state your name, Mr. Bowker,
your residence, and whom you represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bowker</span>. My name is Richard Rogers Bowker. I speak as
vice-president of the American Copyright League, commonly called the
Authors' Copyright League.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman, the American Copyright League, for which I speak as
vice-president in the absence of its president, Mr. Edmund Clarence
Stedman, who regrets in this letter that ill-health detains him in New
York, and who desires to be recorded as well satisfied with the bill as
a basis for Congressional consideration, and in the absence of our
secretary, Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson, of the Century, who has been
our sentinel for years in respect to all matters as to copyright
legislation, the American Copyright League asks that the first half
hour be devoted by your committee to the originators of copyright
property.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Clemens, I understand, has reached Washington, and hopes to be
present at one of these sessions as a member of the council of our
league. Mr. Bronson Howard, the president of the American Dramatists'
Club, and also a vice-president of this league, I hope will be present
to speak for the dramatists. Mr. Sousa and Mr. Victor Herbert are here
to-day representing musical composers. Mr. Frank D. Millet is here as
the delegate of the National Academy of Design and of the Fine Arts
Federation, and possibly Mr. Carl Bitter, president, or Mr. Daniel C.
French, ex-president of the National Sculptors' Association, may also
be here. We ask that a half hour be given to those gentlemen presently;
and I shall occupy but five minutes or so of that time.
</p>

<p>
The conference, sir, proceeded at its first session on a memorandum
which formed the basis for discussion, presented by the American
Copyright League; and I mention that to say that that memorandum
included two important suggestions which were not incorporated in the
bill&mdash;one the suggestion that the bill should be, as it were, a group
of bills, representing separately and distinctively the literary,
dramatic, musical, and artistic varieties of copyrightable property. An
honest endeavor was made to do that, but it proved not practicable and
workable. Again, members of our council, Mr. Stedman and Mr. Clemens
among them, desired very much that the authors should be safeguarded in
their relations with publishers by certain insertions in the bill. It
was held by the legal authorities that that was not a proper subject of
introduction in a copyright code; and on those two points the American
Copyright League, I think I am authorized to state, recedes from any
possible dissension. And I say it, sir, because there are doubtless
many points on which the several organizations would prefer to have
additions or omissions.
</p>

<p>
A little girl I knew spoke of a compromise as something where everybody
got what they did not want. Now, in that sense this bill is not a
compromise. It represents, rather, the consensus of opinion of the
originators of copyrightable property, of the reproducers, publishers
and similar interests, and of representatives, as Mr. Putnam has told
you, of various other interests. On behalf of the league we believe,
sir, that you have before you a working basis for a just, broad, clear,
workable copyright bill; and we feel confident that such a bill will
emerge from your deliberations.
</p>

<p>
We ask you, sir, to keep in mind two vital points: First, that the
rights of the producing classes shall be first of all thought of, but
not to the detriment of the great body of reproducers and readers, on
whom the author classes depend for the possibility of realizing from
their productions. As has been said to you, copyright is on a different
basis from patents, in that it not only does not interfere with the
rights or privileges of others as succeeding inventors, but that the
world is the better for any original work contributed by help of the
copyright laws to the community without detriment to anyone, and
therefore it should have a broader scope before you in copyright
legislation than in patent legislation; and we ask that in that view,
in that spirit, the rights of the producing classes shall be kept in
mind.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, sir, this is a very difficult and complicated question. Those
of us who have met in conference have recognized most fully the care,
fairness, and wise consideration which have been given to all interests
by the copyright office and the difficulties under which a practical
bill has been framed. We ask you, sir, in your considerations in the
committee and in the discussions in Congress so far as they are shaped
by the committee, that you will keep in mind, sir, the importance of
keeping a consistent bill throughout these difficult provisions. The
copyright office has been of the greatest service to all of us in that
very function; and I have no doubt, sir, from our experience, that it
will be of the greatest service to your committee.
</p>

<p>
The league had stood for a copyright commission instead of this
conference. But when we find this bill, sir, presented as the result of
only a year's work, and remember that the English copyright commission
took years to produce a draft which has not yet, after nearly a
generation, been enacted into law, we can not but express the greatest
satisfaction with the result now before you. We do not feel, sir, that
any bill can be presented to your committee which does not call for the
most careful consideration, for protest from outside interests, and for
discussion, not only in your committee and in the halls of Congress,
but throughout the public. We do not feel that any such bill would be
possible; and I wish very heartily, sir, to record the American
copyright league as favoring the fullest discussion and the fullest
consideration of any of what may be called the minority interests. We
believe that the interests of the office are perfectly consistent with
the interests of the public; and in that view, sir, we support most
heartily, individually and as members of the conference, the bill which
you have before you.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF FRANK D. MILLET.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Millet</span>. I shall have very little to say, Mr. Chairman. The
artists are interested in this bill because, as the committee
undoubtedly understands, the copyright of a picture is often, almost
always, more valuable to the artist than the original work&mdash;that is, of
greater money value. We have had long experience with the law, and we
have not found that we have been protected. So little protection has
been afforded that it is no longer the habit for the artist to
copyright his picture. We have gone out of the business of
copyrighting, practically, as you will find if you will go to any
exhibition, because we have not been able to get any relief in case our
work had been infringed upon. We have always objected to the copyright
notice which we have been obliged to put on the picture, because it is
considered a disfigurement. That is another reason why we have not
copyrighted. That has been a very great loss to us as a class. That has
been one of the reasons why we prefer, many of us, to spend much of our
time abroad.
</p>

<p>
If you will pardon me for a moment I will give a personal instance.
</p>

<p>
I have painted in England and in Europe over twenty years. I never had
one bit of difficulty with my copyrights over there, and I have had
considerable income from my copyrights; and I think $7 or $8 is about
all the money I have ever gotten in America out of copyrights here.
</p>

<p>
Since the conferences began last winter two of my pictures have been
reproduced by a journal in New York, one of them in color. They cut off
my name and copyrighted the picture themselves. In the case of the
other they left my copyright on and published it without my consent. I
have absolutely no redress, because the law says that I can get a
dollar for every copy found in their possession, and they were not
fools enough to have any copies in their possession, of course. I
relate this little personal tale, because that is what has been the
experience of all the artists, painters, and sculptors.
</p>

<p>
We do not pretend to say that this bill, in these particular cases, or
in the first case of notice, meets our highest desire, because we would
like to have it exactly as it is abroad, no notice being required
whatever. But we met our friends, our dearest foes, the reproducers,
and made this compromise, which is satisfactory to us on the question
of the notice, as to what we shall put on the picture without
disfigurement, and we think that the bill is the best one that we could
possibly agree to, and we are all of us fully in favor of the bill as
it stands.
</p>

<p>
I thank you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Is the bill as it is drawn at present satisfactory
to you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Millet</span>. It is satisfactory to us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. And you want it passed just as it is?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Millet</span>. We would like to have it passed as it is.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. That would protect the artists?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Millet</span>. As far as we can make out, that would protect us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Is it the criminal remedy that is provided by
this bill that would give the protection you need?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Millet</span>. That is one of the things.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. What are the new remedies given to the artists by
the provisions of this bill?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Millet</span>. At the end of the bill you will find them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Just state them from memory.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Millet</span>. There is a misdemeanor clause that we are very
keen on, the same as for the dramatists. We do not see why it should
not be a misdemeanor, to apply to us as well as to the
dramatists&mdash;sections 23 and 25.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF JOHN PHILIP SOUSA.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would much rather have my brass
band here. I think it would be more appreciated than my words will be.
[Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. We would rather have you, just now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman, I would like to quote Fletcher, of Saltoun, who said that
he cared not who made the laws of the land if he could write its songs.
We composers of America take the other view. We are very anxious as to
who makes the laws of this land. We are in a very bad way. I think when
the old copyright law was made, the various perforated rolls and
phonograph records were not known, and there was no provision made to
protect us in that direction. Since then, the talking machines have
come out, and the claim is made that the record of sound is not a
notation.
</p>

<p>
There are three ways for the composer to make a living by his music: By
sight or by sound or by touch. The notation of my compositions or the
compositions of any other composer for the blind must be entirely
different from the ordinary, because it must be read by the sense of
touch. The notation that is made for a combination of instruments is
brought out by sound. The claim that is made about these records is
that they can not be read by any notation&mdash;simply that no method has
been found to read them up to the present time, but there will be. Just
as the man who wanted to scan the heavens discovered a telescope to do
it. No doubt there will be found a way to read these records.
</p>

<p>
We are entirely in favor of this bill. The provisions satisfy us, and
we want to be protected in every possible form in our property. When
these perforated-roll companies and these phonograph companies take my
property and put it on their records they take something that I am
interested in and give me no interest in it. When they make money out
of my pieces I want a share of it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. They are protected in their inventions?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. And why should you not be protected in yours?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. That is my claim. They have to buy the brass that
they make their funnels out of, and they have to buy the wood that they
make the box out of, and the material for the disk; and that disk as it
stands, without the composition of an American composer on it, is not
worth a penny. Put the composition of an American composer on it and it
is worth $1.50. What makes the difference? The stuff that we write.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. What is the protection by the terms of this bill
that is given you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. That in any production of our music by any of these
mechanical instruments they must make a contract with us or with our
publishers; that they must pay us money for the use of our
compositions.
</p>

<p>
The publishers of this country make contracts with the composers, and
agree to give them a sum outright or a royalty on sales for each and
every copy that they publish and sell.
</p>

<p>
The companies making records for talking machines take one copy of a
copyrighted piece of music and produce by their method a thousand or
more disks, cylinders, or perforated rolls. If they would buy one copy
from my publishers and owners of my copyright and sell that one copy, I
would have no objection; but they take the copyrighted copy and make
what they claim is a noncopyrighted copy, sell it, and do not give the
owner of the copyright a penny of royalty for its use; and they could
not do this if the composer had not written it and the publisher had
not published it, and I want to be paid for the use they make of my
property.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Does this affect records already made?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. No; it does not affect existing copyrights.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. No. That is a sop&mdash;I am willing to let it stand for
the sake of the future, but I think it is wrong. That is a sop to them,
the talking-machine companies, and hereafter they will make money after
this law passes on the pieces that I made before the law went into
effect.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. So that we will get "El Capitan" from the
phonographs in various places?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Yes, sir; and I'll get nothing for it; and I am the
man that made "El Capitan." [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
I speak in the interest of the publishers and the composers, and some
of them asked me to come here because I could talk from the heart, and
I do. I am sure of what I say. There may be some interests opposed to
the bill for selfish reasons, but these interests know the bill simply
gives us rights we are entitled to.
</p>

<p>
As to the artists, Mr. Millet said that he got $8.75 for one of his
pictures. You can take any catalogue of records of any talking machine
company in this country and you will find from 20 to 100 of my
compositions on it. I have yet to receive the first penny for the use
of them.
</p>

<p>
There is another point to consider. These talking machines are going to
ruin the artistic development of music in this country. When I was a
boy&mdash;I was born in this town&mdash;in front of every house in the summer
evenings you would find young people together singing the songs of the
day or the old songs. To-day you hear these infernal machines going
night and day. [Laughter.] We will not have a vocal chord left.
[Laughter.] The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of
evolution, as was the tail of man when he came from the ape. The vocal
chords will go because no one will have a chance to sing, the
phonograph supplying a mechanical imitation of the voice,
accompaniment, and effort.
</p>

<p>
On this river, when I was a young man, we went out boating and the
music of young voices filled the air.
</p>

<p>
Last summer and the summer before I was in one of the biggest yacht
harbors of the world, and I did not hear a voice the whole summer.
Every yacht had a gramophone, a phonograph, an Æolian, or something of
the kind. They were playing Sousa marches, and that was all right, as
to the artistic side of it [laughter], but they were not paying for
them, and, furthermore, they were not helping the technical development
of music. Go to the men that manufacture the instruments that are
nearest the people&mdash;the banjo, the guitar, and the mandolin&mdash;and every
one of them will tell you that the sale of those instruments has fallen
off greatly. You can not develop music without these instruments, the
country singing school, and the country brass band. Music develops from
the people, the "folk songs," and if you do not make the people
executants, you make them depend on the machines.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Since the time you speak of, when they used to be
singing in the streets&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Well, Mr. Currier, I am 50 years old&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I was just going to ask you: Since that time, the
law has been passed to protect the authors of musical compositions,
which would prohibit that. Is not that so?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. No, sir; you could always do it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Any public performance is prohibited, is it not,
by that law?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. You would not call that a public performance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. But any public performance is prohibited by the
law of 1897?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Not that I know of at all. I have never known that
it was unlawful to get together and sing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It probably has not been enforced to that extent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. You think it ought to be against the law for some
people to attempt to do it, do you not, Mr. Sousa? [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It is possible that that has deterred the young
people from singing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Would you not consider it a greater crime to turn
on a phonograph&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I do not consider singing a crime.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. If you would make it a misdemeanor, do you not
think it much worse to have a lot of these machines going than to have
a lot of fresh young voices singing?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I think a great many people in this country get a
great deal of comfort out of the phonograph.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. But they get much more out of the human voice, and
I will tell you why: The phonograph companies know that. They pay
Caruso $3,000 to make a record in their machine, because they get the
human voice. And they pay a cornet player $4 to blow one of his blasts
into it. [Laughter.] That is the difference. The people, the homes,
want the human voice. First comes the country singing school, and next
comes the country brass band. Let us do something to help them. You can
do it by making these people pay me for everything that I compose.
[Laughter.]
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF VICTOR HERBERT, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, it is hardly
necessary for me to add anything, I think, to Mr. Sousa's statement. I
think he has made the question very plain and clear.
</p>

<p>
I would like to say this, that both Mr. Sousa and I are not here
representing ourselves as individuals and our personal interests, but
we stand here for many hundreds of poor fellows who have not been able
to come here&mdash;possibly because they have not got the price&mdash;brother
composers whose names figure on the advertisements of these companies
who make perforated rolls and talking machines, etc., and who never
have received a cent, just as is the case with Mr. Sousa and myself.
</p>

<p>
I do not see how they can deny that they sell their roll or their
machine, because they are reproducing a part of our brain, of our
genius, or whatever it might be. They pay, as Mr. Sousa said, the
singer who sings a song into their machines. They pay Mr. Caruso $3,000
for each song&mdash;for each record. He might be singing Mr. Sousa's song,
or my song, and the composer would not receive a cent. I say that that
can not be just. It is as plain a question, Mr. Chairman, as it could
be, to my mind. Morally, there is only one side to it, and I hope you
will see it and recommend the necessary law.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Just an incident: The talking machine company
that pays a singer gets no protection on that record under the law,
either, does it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. I think they do.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Could not a competing talking machine company
immediately reproduce those records?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Well, they would go for them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I have an impression that there is no law under
which they could.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. I think they would.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I think there is no protection at all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. I know that we are not protected. Since the
courts have held that the perforated roll is not an imitation of the
sheet music we have absolutely no ground to stand on.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF MR. HORACE PETTIT.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. I represent the Victor Talking Machine Company.
While I am not here as one of the advocates or proponents of the bill,
it is very fitting, I think, at this time, immediately after Mr.
Sousa's and Mr. Victor Herbert's appearance, that I should state what
we have to say in regard to the talking machines. It may be that Mr.
Herbert and Mr. Sousa have been somewhat abused by the talking-machine
companies. They, however, certainly do not show it in their appearance.
</p>

<p>
Our position is to be equitable and just in the matter. We believe that
there should be protection, and we are willing that this bill, with
certain amendments we have to suggest, should be passed, substantially
on the lines indicated, so that the composer should have the protection
against his music or his compositions being copied on a record of a
talking machine; with the understanding, however, that it does not
apply to subsisting copyrights. I believe that is the understanding as
expressed, although there is some ambiguity in the language, and
therefore I would suggest that section 3, in that regard, be modified,
either by striking out the section or by adding to it. Section 3 reads
(reading):
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 3.</span> That the copyright provided by this act shall
extend to and protect all the copyrightable component parts of the
work copyrighted, any and all reproductions or copies thereof, in
whatever form, style, or size, and all matter reproduced therein in
which copyright is already subsisting, but without extending the
duration of such copyright.
</p></div>


<p>
I therefore would add to that, in view of that somewhat ambiguous
language:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>And provided</i>, That no devices, contrivances, or appliances,
or dies, or matrices for making the same, made prior to the date
this act shall go into effect shall be subject to any subsisting
copyright.
</p></div>


<p>
This, I believe, is the intention of the framers of the bill, although
it is somewhat doubtfully expressed. So much in that regard.
</p>

<p>
Further, gentlemen, if the talking machine companies are to pay the
author and composer, as they will under this act if passed, a royalty
on the copyrighted compositions, the talking machine companies should
also be protected. We might pay Mr. Herbert or Mr. Sousa or Mr. Caruso,
or any of the opera singers, a thousand dollars for making a record. It
is perfectly possible, within the known arts, for that record, after we
have made it, to be reproduced by a mere copperplating process by
somebody else and copied, so that we would pay the thousand dollars or
so and have no protection against the party manufacturing a duplicate
of it. Therefore, not only for that reason, but for the other reasons
which I shall briefly mention, the talking machine manufacturers should
be entitled to register the particular records which they prepare, and
that, therefore, should be included in the act.
</p>

<p>
The bill evidently is intended to cover talking-machine records,
although it is somewhat doubtfully expressed.
</p>

<p>
Section 4 is the section upon which everything more or less hangs, and
that is [reading]:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That the works for which copyright may be secured under this act
shall include all the works of an author.
</p></div>


<p>
That is all that it says in that regard. The purport, however, is to
cover substantially everything that was covered by the former copyright
act. In section 18 the different things copyrighted are specified, in
which section the duration of the terms are provided. Section 18
states, for instance:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
For twenty-eight years after the date of first publication in the
case of any print or label relating to articles of manufacture.
</p></div>

<p>
Then comes a proviso, and then:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
(b) For fifty years after the date of first publication in the case
of any composite or collective work; any work copyrighted by a
corporate body or by the employer of the author or authors; any
abridgment, compilation, dramatization, or translation; any
posthumous work; any arrangement or reproduction in some new form
of a musical composition; any photograph; any reproduction of a
work of art.
</p></div>

<p>
I would suggest that you include in there, on line 14 of page 14, after
the word "composition," the words "any talking-machine record;" so that
there would be no room for doubt but what talking-machine records are
intended to be included.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose I would also amend section 5 (p. 4, lines 2 and 3) by
adding between lines 2 and 3, before the word "Phonographs," the
following: "(j) Talking-machine records."
</p>

<p>
I want to say one more word in that regard: The talking-machine record
is a new art. At the time that the former acts were passed and the
Revised Statutes it had not acquired the state of perfection in which
it is to-day. The talking machine is a writing upon a record
tablet&mdash;not to be read visually, but audibly to be read through the
medium of a vibrating pencil engaging in the record groove. This
reproduces the thing that is uttered, in the characteristic manner in
which it is uttered, and therefore that particular thing ought to be
the subject-matter of a property right.
</p>

<p>
For instance, we might say that a particular piece would be sung or
played by some country brass band, such as Mr. Sousa alludes to. The
instrumentation there of that particular piece as recorded would be as
different from the instrumentation of the particular piece when played
by Mr. Sousa himself, from the stage of one of the great opera houses,
as could be imagined; and what should be protected there is the
particular instrumentation as it is played by Mr. Sousa, as he has
rendered it. The same thing applies to any orator, or any actor, or any
recitationist. It is a picture of the voice, as perfectly as a
photograph is the picture of a man, or of a thing; and all the
personality and all the characteristics of speech of the man uttering
it are there recorded.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. Do you mean that if that lecturer delivers the
lecture to one of the talking machines that you should take a copyright
upon that disk, or whatever it is, that record, I suppose is what you
call it, so as to prevent him from giving another reproduction of the
same lecture to another talking machine?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. No, sir. That would be his right. His lecture is
copyrightable. He has a perfect right to copyright that in the ordinary
manner, and he has the further right, if he pleases, to have it
copyrighted through the means of a talking-machine record, or, with his
permission, we could do so. But wherever the thing is primarily
copyrighted we could not use it in any sense without his permission.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. Yes; but after he has copyrighted it and you have
got his permission to use it in your particular talking machine and
have paid him whatever you may have agreed to pay him as compensation
for the use of it, would you seek to prohibit him from giving that same
lecture to another talking machine?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. That would depend entirely on the terms of the
contract; but that is not the idea at all. It is merely the means of
recording a voice, the production of a particular man or band, or
instrumentation, with all the characteristics of that particular voice
or instrumentation, which we think should be subject to copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Do you not think, then, if you want that sort of
an amendment to section 18 that you should also amend section 4?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. No, sir; I do not think that is necessary.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You think that includes it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. I think section 4 is broad enough to include it.
You will understand that section 4 is understood to include a
photograph. It is understood to include everything which is the
subject-matter of copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I was just about to ask this: Understanding that
this talking machine is a new arrangement, and was invented later than
the date of the original copyright law, by that very fact it might be
necessary to mention it in section 4.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. Well, I assumed that the word "author," as used by
the Librarian of Congress in presenting the bill, was sufficiently
broad to include anything which was originated of that character: and,
as interpreted by the courts, for instance in the Sarony case (111 U.
S. Repts., 59), it has been decided that the word "writing" was broad
enough to include a photograph, and that therefore it would not be
necessary to amend section 4, provided section 18 had specifically in
it the words "talking-machine record," showing that it was meant to be
included. Of course I should not object to including it. I should not
object at all to having section 4 amended for that purpose, but I doubt
whether it would be necessary under the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You would be satisfied without its amendment?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. I think so, provided the talking-machine record
was inserted in sections 5 and 18.
</p>

<p>
There should be no question but that the particular characteristic
utterances of a singer, or recitationist, or of an actor, or of an
orator, or the particular instrumentation of a pianist, or leader of an
orchestra, etc., independent of the composition itself, whether it is
copyrighted or not, should be equally entitled to protection, as a
photograph or reproduction of a work of art.
</p>

<p>
The present-day thoughts and ideas may be recorded and reproduced
through this new form of writing&mdash;that is, by recording the uttered
sound upon a properly prepared surface in a sound groove, by which
the varied undulations of the voice are formed in the groove by
corresponding undulations, lateral or vertical. Here we have a true
writing of the voice, recording uttered sound, recording not only
words, thoughts, and ideas, but also recording the special particular
expression and characteristic method of speech employed by the person
uttering the sound. In other words, we have the exact voice, with all
its individuality recorded, to be reproduced through the medium of the
reproducing device employing a stylus operating in the groove.
</p>

<p>
Certainly a sound record is within the contemplation of the Constitution
and should be unquestionably included in this proposed new act relative
to copyrights.
</p>

<p>
It matters not whether the subject-matter of the record is otherwise
copyrightable or not. If the piece played is copyrighted as a musical
composition it can not be reproduced on a sound record, in accordance
with the bill, without the permission of the composer. A Paderewski,
however, may play the copyrighted selection, and a record of his
rendition of it, with all his personality and individuality thrown into
the piece, should be entitled to a copyright on a sound record for
reproducing purposes.
</p>

<p>
This is true, also, of the voice of a Caruso or a Melba singing either
a copyrighted or uncopyrighted piece. It is true, also, as a further
illustration, of the recitation by Henry Irving of "Eugene Aram's
Dream." What is here copyrighted in these records is the individuality
and personality of the rendition by the performer. It is the picture of
the voice or of the instrumentation as, for instance, a copyrighted
photograph is a picture of a person or thing.
</p>

<p>
Should another performer play the same piece played by a Paderewski the
personality of Paderewski would be absolutely wanting, and the same
difference between the two performances of the same composition would
be in the respective sound records as would exist at the actual
performance of the respective pieces. The same differences between
Caruso's rendition of a selection from Rigoletto and a concert-hall
singer's rendition of the same would exist in the sound record and the
reproduction therefrom as would exist in the actual singing of the
selection. This is true regarding the personality of every voice and
instrumentation recorded.
</p>

<p>
A large portion of the selections, musical and recitational, on
talking-machine records are not copyrightable or copyrighted. These
records, however, with all their originality, personality of the
recitationist or singer, and peculiarity of arrangement, etc., should
be copyrighted, and the private competitor prevented from purloining an
artistic and characteristic production.
</p>

<p>
So-called talking-machine records in this respect differ quite
materially from the mechanical organ and piano for the reason that a
so-called talking-machine record is an exact record of all the
modulations, and all the characteristic articulations of the voice, as
well as of all the characteristics of an instrumentation. In other
words, it is an exact picture of all the merits and demerits of the
original, and the original is reproduced with an exactness, so that
frequently, at a distance, in the present perfected state of the art,
the reproduction may very well be mistaken for the original.
</p>

<p>
This record of the voice and instrumentation for sound reproducing is
an art which was not commercially available or perfected when the
earlier copyright laws were passed, and therefore was not included.
</p>

<p>
The following were submitted by Mr. Pettit at the meeting of June 8,
1906, embodying his proposed amendments to the bill:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="ralign">
<span class="sc">June 7, 1906.</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>To the honorable Joint Committee of the Senate and House of
Representatives.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gentlemen</span>: Referring to the proposed bill, "To amend and
consolidate the acts respecting copyrights," now before the
committee, I would propose the following amendments:
</p>

<p>
Amend section 3 (p. 3, line 8) by adding continuously at the end of
said section the following:
</p>

<p>
"<i>And provided</i>, That no devices, contrivances, or appliances,
or dies, or matrices for making the same, such as referred to in
clause (<i>g</i>), section 1, made prior to the date this act shall
go into effect, shall be subject to any subsisting copyright."
</p>

<p>
Amend section 5 (page 4, lines 2 to 3) by adding between lines 2
and 3, before the word "Photographs," the following: "(<i>j</i>)
Talking-machine records."
</p>

<p>
Amend section 18, clause (<i>b</i>), (page 14, line 14) by adding
between the word "composition" and the word "any" the words "any
talking-machine record."
</p>

<p>
Amend section 23 by striking out from the clause marked "First"
(page 17, lines 18 to 20) the following: "or any device especially
adapted to reproduce to the ear any copyrighted work."
</p>

<p>
Amend section 23 by inserting in the clause marked "Fourth" (page
18, line 4), between the words "of" and "all," the following: "any
device, contrivance, or appliance mentioned in section 1, clause
(<i>g</i>) and."
</p>

<p>
These amendments to section 23 are for the purpose of making the
penalty relative to unlawful use of devices, etc., enumerated in
section 1, Clause Z, one dollar instead of ten, which latter amount
is excessive. It puts the device for reproducing sound on basis of
books, etc., instead of in the class of paintings, statuary, or
sculpture.
</p>

<p>
A brief memorandum of argument will be submitted later.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. I would like to ask Mr. Sousa a question. I was
very much interested in your statement, Mr. Sousa, pertaining to
talking machines taking the place of the human voice, and I will ask
you this question: If you were protected in your productions and
received a royalty from the talking machines, would that lessen the use
of the talking machines any and strengthen the use of the voice and the
brass band and the home choir, and so on?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I do not think so, but I think it will reduce two
wrongs to one.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Then, it is simply a question of your receiving
the royalty that you think you are entitled to?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. I think there are other causes besides the
general use of the talking machine that account for the fact that there
is less singing than there used to be. I think we do not live quite as
close to nature as we used to, and that that is what used to make us
sing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. That is very true. But the more leeway you give the
talking machine the greater encroachments they will make. If they are
made to pay a royalty on all compositions that they use, perhaps they
will not have so many bad ones in their records. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. That is what I intended to find out, as to
whether it was simply a personal affair.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Is not the real reason that if it protects you
and other composers, there is an incentive to you to compose?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Oh, yes; I can compose better if I get a thousand
dollars than I can for six hundred. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. That is the real reason.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF PAUL FULLER, ESQ., OF NEW YORK.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. My original r&ocirc;le, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, was
as one of the members of the Bar Association of New York, and as
chairman of the committee to express to you gentlemen all the efforts
that had been made and the most extraordinary result that has been
accomplished from conflicting interests in getting up the framework of
this bill, and to say on behalf of a number of the conferees, we will
call them&mdash;the American Publishers' Copyright League, the America
Publishers' Association, the National Academy of Design, the Fine Arts
Federation, the Music Publishers' Association, the American Library
Association, the Print Publishers, the Engraving Copyright League, the
United Typothet&aelig;, and the National Typographical Union&mdash;that they felt
that a great achievement had been reached in getting the framework of
this bill in its present condition. It is in such shape now that when
anything is the matter with it we know where to apply the remedy. In
the present chaotic condition of the copyright laws it would require an
X ray to find where the mistake was and how to remedy it.
</p>

<p>
I did not intend to say more than a word, but the suggestions made by
the last speaker, Mr. Pettit, are of so vicious a character&mdash;not
intentionally so, but they show precisely how a good bill can be made
bad&mdash;that I am going to extend my remarks for the five or ten minutes
required to point out why they should not be regarded at all.
</p>

<p>
For instance, take section 3. Our friend wants to alter that, and it is
absolutely unalterable if justice and common sense are to prevail. All
that section says is that the copyright shall extend to all the
copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted, any and all
reproductions or copies thereof, in whatever form, style, or size, and
all matter reproduced therein in which copyright is already subsisting.
</p>

<p>
If there is no copyright subsisting to keep a man from singing my song
through a phonograph, there is no harm done. If it is subsisting, he
must pay the penalty, and the courts will ultimately determine that.
The question is now before the courts. It seems to me strange that any
court should hesitate to say that a man who not only copies my
notation, but who actually reproduces the music, the sound, should not
be required to pay me for that privilege. If a man engraves my music
and sells it by the sheet, he is a counterfeiter, and I can get money
from him and punish him, but if he does more than that&mdash;if he completes
that counterfeit to the extent of the reproduction of the actual sound
that the composer had in his brain when he put it there&mdash;they say he
has not imitated. That question is before the courts. Do not touch it.
Do not touch it. This new law makes it certain for the future, but do
not endeavor to touch the past. Let the courts decide what the present
law is.
</p>

<p>
I say that the present law will protect these gentlemen from that
piracy&mdash;because it is the ultimate form of piracy. It goes further than
the reproduction of the composer's music sheet. It reproduces the
sound. So that they have taken everything from the music man when they
reproduce it on the disk. Therefore I say leave this provision in the
bill: "And all matter reproduced therein in which copyright is already
subsisting." Do not touch it.
</p>

<p>
In section 18 my friend (Mr. Pettit) wants to have the disks
copyrighted. Mr. Bonynge put his finger right on the point of that
proposition, and perhaps it is unwise for me to say anything further.
That is a patentable device, and it has been patented, and there is
nothing original on that disk&mdash;nothing original to the company that
makes that disk. The company has borrowed it or bought it or stolen it
from somebody else, and they want to copyright that. For heaven's sake,
let the copyright stop somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bonynge said: "Would you prevent the man who sang into your
phonograph, or talked into it, from singing or talking into any other?"
Certainly not. It is not an original production. It is not the work of
an author or composer or artist. There is nothing intellectual about
it, except that it is scientific, and the scientific part of it is
protected by his patent. The reason I am so emphatic about that is that
when you endeavor to put in the ideas of patents and the protection of
inventions into this law you dislocate it and disarrange it.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Lattimer</span>. The musician may memorize that music, and
may entertain an audience with it, but he can not sing it into a
phonograph; is that it? According to your position, as I understand it,
the singer may take the music of Mr. Sousa, commit it to memory, and
may stand before an audience and entertain the audience with Mr.
Sousa's music and reproduce it to the audience, but he can not
reproduce it in a phonograph?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. If he has paid Mr. Sousa for the privilege of that
public performance. But he can not, at the same time, under the payment
for the privilege of a one-night stand, sing it into a phonograph and
give it to a million people all over the country.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. And he can not give that public performance
unless he has paid Mr. Sousa his royalty?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. No.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. Would not the copyrighting of this phonograph
record give the musician, say Mr. Sousa, double protection? He already
has the protection of the copyright on his sheet music, has he not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. And he would have the further protection of the
copyright of the music as it goes into the phonograph, would he not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. No; it is the talking-machine people who want a
copyright on that, and to hold it against the original composer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I did not understand Mr. Pettit that way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. Mr. Sousa is entitled to it, whether he prints his
music on a sheet of paper or whether he prints it on a disk; but the
man that prints it on the disk is not entitled to it. That is all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. He has not originated anything.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. No.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. Except that the disk is a patentable thing, and
on that he has a patent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Fuller</span>. Yes. The bill is a compromise, and one which every
lawyer here and every lawyer who was at the conference thinks he can
better; but it is the best that could be had to protect and satisfy all
the interests. It has been stated that perhaps none of the interests
are entirely satisfied. If that is true, it is the best kind of a bill.
There are only two kinds: The bill that is perfect, the one that
satisfies everybody&mdash;and there is none such; and the one that satisfies
nobody, because nobody has had injustice done.

<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF STEPHEN H. OLIN, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, a number of different
bodies, mainly publishing and reproducing bodies, which participated in
this conference, thought it proper, in view of the dignity of this
occasion, the unprecedented meeting of the committees of the two
Houses, that they should collectively say in very few words what they
all thought of this bill, that so they could best serve the committee,
so they could best provide that nothing should belittle the force of
the language of the President or the clearness of the presentation as
to the bill made by the Librarian.
</p>

<p>
These bodies who have authorized me to speak in their behalf in this
matter are the Academy of Design, the Fine Arts Federation, the
American Publishers' Association, the American Publishers' Copyright
League, which two bodies include practically all the publishers of the
United States; the United Typothet&aelig;, which include all the great
employing printers of the United States; the Music Publishers'
Association, some forty-two music publishers who, by habit, not only
represent themselves but those musicians who rely upon them for
protection; the Photographers' League of America, the Print Publishers'
Association, which two bodies represent largely the illustrating
interests of the country; the International Typographical Union, which,
as the committee knows, represents the typesetters and printers; and
finally the American Library Association, wish me on their behalf to
say that this bill in its present form has their substantial approval.
It is understood that suggestions of modifications as to detail may be
made by these organizations individually through the Librarian of
Congress; and I submit their signed paper to that effect to the
committee.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that this simple statement on behalf of
these bodies carries a very strong prima facie argument in favor of
this bill. The greater part of the effort of the authors of this bill
has been to provide in that field of copyright which Congress has
already bounded and established, and which the existing law creates, a
reasonable and orderly regulation; to provide against these conflicts
and uncertainties and difficulties which the repeated amendment of the
law has brought about.
</p>

<p>
I think everybody would, further, be glad if there could be such a bill
as most men could read with some intelligence; that would not need not
merely a lawyer, but a copyright lawyer, to interpret. I think most men
would be glad, furthermore, in view of the importance of international
copyright, if it were such a bill as an intelligent foreigner could
understand and an intelligent foreign lawyer could advise about, and
such a bill as that the people who are used to it here would thereby be
taught something of the general copyright law and could better
understand foreign rules. But at any rate, these organizations whose
names I have read to you represent, with some few exceptions, roughly,
the whole body of men interested in the actual working of the law. Most
of them, I think, except those who are purely authors and creators,
like the arts associations, have at some time or other been on each
side of a copyright controversy. In their business some of them are
owners of copyrights and desire to enforce their copyright as far as
possible, and most of them are also desirous at times of using literary
or artistic matter which is protected by copyright, and they desire
that the law shall be precise, so that they can understand their rights
and not unwittingly be guilty of offense.
</p>

<p>
So, for all these reasons, it seems to me that when they come to you
and say, substantially, "This law is satisfactory to us," you may be
sure that prima facie there is a law here that is an improvement on
what at present exists, and which, on the whole, will give a reasonable
and sane regulation of this most important matter. And of course if any
of them come to you with special ideas as to improvement, you will hear
and pass upon them for what they are worth.
</p>

<p>
I am going to leave that without any argument, because it seems to me
the fact itself is persuasive and that it must impress this committee
with the substantial value of this bill that has been presented.
</p>

<p>
There is one thing which the committee will naturally scrutinize with
great attention, and that is every provision of this bill which in any
respect seems to extend the field of copyright as Congress has
previously bounded it; that is to say, which gives copyright upon some
new article, or extends the term of copyright, or gives copyright to
people who did not formerly possess it, or which in any degree limits
the right of the public as against the copyright owner. The bill, I
think, makes no very large incursion into that region, but it is that
region which, I am sure, this committee will principally wish to
examine. With your permission, I shall briefly speak of those things
which occur to me as to such extensions.
</p>

<p>
First of all, the bill does extend the privilege of copyright to
preventing the reproduction of musical sound or spoken words by
machinery. That was spoken of before the committee yesterday. All that
I can say about it is that this body whom I represent, although some of
them have special interests in it (and they wish to be heard on it
hereafter), in general look upon the matter as the circuit court of the
United States in the second circuit looked upon it in their last
decision on the subject, as being a matter germane to the copyright
law, relating to the same kind of rights that Congress has hitherto
protected, and that they see no reason why such rights should not
hereafter be properly protected; and they respectfully refer the
committee, so far as their suggestion goes, to the special information
and advice of those on both sides of the question who have the greatest
interest in it and the greatest capacity to inform the committee in
regard to it.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Can you give the citation of the decision that
you have mentioned?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I can hand it to you. A printed copy of the decision
was handed to me yesterday. It has not yet been reported.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That was the decision that was distributed
yesterday?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Yes; that is the one.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Unless there is objection on the part of the
committee, we will have this decision put in the record.
</p>

<p>
(The decision referred to is as follows:)
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ctr">
UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, SECOND CIRCUIT.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
White-Smith Music Publishing Company, appellant, against Apollo
Company, respondent.
</p>

<p>
Judges Lacombe, Coxe, and Townsend.
</p>

<p>
These causes come here upon appeal from a decree of the United
States circuit court for the southern district of New York
dismissing bill alleging infringement of copyright. The facts are
stated in the opinion of the court below. (139 Fed. 427.)
</p>

<p>
Per curiam: The questions raised in these cases are of vast
importance and involve far-reaching results. They have been
exhaustively discussed in the clear and forcible briefs and
arguments of counsel. We are of the opinion that the rights sought
to be protected by these suits belong to the same class as those
covered by the specific provisions of the copyright statutes, and
that the reasons which led to the passage of said statutes apply
with great force to the protection of rights of copyright against
such an appropriation of the fruits of an author's conception as
results from the acts of defendant.
</p>

<p>
But in view of the fact that the law of copyright is a creature of
statute and is not declaratory of the common law and that it
confers distinctive and limited rights, which did not exist at the
common law, we are constrained to hold that it must be strictly
construed and that we are not at liberty to extend its provisions,
either by resort to equitable considerations or to a strained
interpretation of the terms of the statute.
</p>

<p>
We are therefore of the opinion that a perforated paper roll, such
as is manufactured by defendant, is not a copy of complainant's
staff notation, for the following reasons:
</p>

<p>
It is not a copy in fact; it is not designed to be read or actually
used in reading music as the original staff notation is; and the
claim that it may be read, which is practically disproved by the
great preponderance of evidence, even if true, would establish
merely a theory or possibility of use, as distinguished from an
actual use. The argument that because the roll is a notation or
record of the music, it is, therefore, a copy, would apply to the
disk of the phonograph or the barrel of the organ, which, it must
be admitted, are not copies of the sheet music. The perforation in
the rolls are not a varied form of symbols substituted for the
symbols used by the author. They are mere adjuncts of a valve
mechanism in a machine. In fact, the machine, or musical playing
device, is the thing which appropriates the author's property and
publishes it by producing the musical sounds, thus conveying the
author's composition to the public.
</p>

<p>
The decree is affirmed, with costs.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. The second extension or modification of the present
rights of the copyright proprietor as against the public are those
instances mentioned yesterday by the chairman of the House committee in
regard to the exceptions to the prohibition of importation. As the law
stands to-day the importation into this country of a book which is
copyrighted here is prohibited, and there are certain exceptions, in
the first case, of certain libraries and colleges who may import not
exceeding two copies in one invoice, and individuals who may import not
exceeding two copies in one invoice. This bill makes a modification of
the present rule.
</p>

<p>
I would like to call the attention of the committee to the reason why
the present law is as it is, and the reason why this suggestion of
amendment is made. Of course, prior to 1891 there was nothing like this
in the law. The law was perfectly simple, and had been perfectly simple
for a hundred years. There could be no importation of the copyrighted
article from abroad without the consent of the copyright proprietor.
With his consent it could be freely imported. So far as I know there
had never been the slightest dissatisfaction on the part of copyright
proprietors or of the public with the working of that rule. As a matter
of fact, it was to the interest of the copyright proprietor to bring
in, I will say, the English edition of the book which he was publishing
here, and to sell it&mdash;and so far as the public wanted it they always
got it&mdash;at his shop or at other shops, through the regular channels of
trade, so that the public and he alike were perfectly satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Were there any importations before 1881?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Before 1891? I think there were.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. With the consent of the copyright proprietor?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I think, as a matter of fact, if you went into a
bookstore you always found and could buy, at a somewhat higher
price&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That is not the question. Were there any
importations of such books?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. There were, by the copyright proprietors, who put
them on sale and sold them through the trade.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Importations solely by the proprietor of the
copyright&mdash;not by individuals?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Yes, sir; not by individuals. Congress undertook in
1891 to do two things: First, to admit to the privileges of copyright
the foreigners resident in certain countries; and, second, to require
that the manufacture of copyrighted books should be by American
typesetters and plate makers here in this country. And they undertook
to do these things with the minimum changes in the language of the
statute. They inserted a few words in one section, and then a few words
in another, and both of the desired results were brought about, just as
they exist to-day. Then, in the last part of the discussion in
Congress, as I remember it&mdash;and I am open to correction as to the
historical account&mdash;it became apparent that the typesetter was not duly
protected if only those changes were made, for the reason that the
copyright proprietor, having the free right to import books from
abroad, might perhaps comply with the typesetting clause colorably
only, in an imperfect way, and might satisfy the public demand for his
books by importation of those set up and printed abroad. Therefore, at
the typesetters' request, there was imposed a prohibition of
importation which affected the whole world, including the copyright
proprietor. Nobody could import books.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That was a perfectly satisfactory provision.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. That was a perfectly satisfactory provision, both to
the copyright owner and to the typesetter; but then the general public
were heard, and they said "no;" an English edition may be better than
an American edition, for one reason or another, and you must not
deprive us of the privilege of getting the best books. Libraries were
heard, and individuals were heard. And Congress then hit upon this
expedient, which was very simple and on the whole has been very
effectual. Congress said:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
But this prohibition shall not apply in the cases mentioned in
certain specified sections referred to of the tariff act.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The sections of the tariff act referred to enumerated a certain number
of classes which Congress had thought were worthy of benefit from the
Government to the extent of allowing them to import books in limited
numbers free from duty. So there was ready-made for the hands of
Congress a certain list of people who import books who might be allowed
to benefit at the expense of the copyright proprietor, just as they had
been theretofore benefited at the expense of the customs. That is the
law as it stands to-day.
</p>

<p>
Then Congress added this further provision, that any individual also
shall be allowed to import not exceeding two copies in one invoice on
payment of the duty thereon, for use, and not for sale.
</p>

<p>
Like every other provision of a law after it has been duly tested by
use, it is fair to bring it before the legislature again and to call
attention to its results, and that is especially true where the
provision of law was necessarily adopted with haste and was obviously a
mere expedient for arriving at a wished-for result. And when this
conference convened the publishers said: "To some extent this section
has worked badly in certain ways," which I shall now point out. The
librarians in libraries and the colleges have generally availed
themselves of this privilege, being coupled with the privilege to
import without the payment of duty, and have imported copyrighted books
in those ways in large numbers. How far individuals have availed
themselves of their privilege it is impossible, or at all events would
be difficult, to tell; probably not to any great extent. The number of
men who care so much for an English edition of a book that they are
willing to write for it to a London bookseller and import it themselves
is not very large.
</p>

<p>
So far as it goes, the privilege of importation is an inroad on the
rights given to the copyright proprietor. It is an inconsiderable
inroad so far as most popular books&mdash;novels and the like&mdash;which have
circulation are concerned. The few hundred books that come to
individuals here amount to not a very substantial burden upon the
proprietor of such copyrights. But there are certain classes of books,
expensive to produce, and with a very limited circulation&mdash;books of a
scientific character, books illustrated with plates&mdash;and they circulate
among the precise classes; that is, the libraries and the colleges and
these individuals who are particular about their libraries, the precise
individuals who import books under these exceptions; and there were
instances brought before the conference where publishers here had
declined to undertake a book which would have been valuable to the
public, which would have been valuable to the typesetter to set up, and
the American publisher to bring out, and to the American bookseller to
sell, for the reason that the very limited public which these books
addressed would all, in the natural course of events, have their
demands filled through these exceptions to the prohibition of
importations.
</p>

<p>
That did not hurt the libraries or the individuals who habitually get
English editions. It did hurt, we maintain, the American public, the
reading public, and a great many individuals among the American
producing classes. So that there was a modification requested of the
present rules, and the modification in regard to the libraries is this:
There is to be not exceeding one copy to be introduced on an invoice,
the privilege is not to relate to books which have their origin here in
America. With your permission, I will briefly explain those two points.
In the first place, ordinarily a library or a college needs only one
book at a time. If it needs another copy of the same book it is not too
much to ask that it make another importation to bring it in. Under the
present rule, while delicate and careful men would not take advantage
of it, it is constantly a temptation to a librarian who can import free
of duty and free of the copyright proprietor's claims, two copies of a
book from England, to import one for the legitimate use of the library
and one for some other use. The effect of that influence can not be
particularly measured.
</p>

<p>
The other point is one which can be clearly understood. It is now the
right of colleges and libraries, an important right, that in case of an
English book they should be able to get the English edition, which in
some instances is more complete or for other reasons better than the
American edition. But it can almost never be an important right to
obtain the English edition of an American book since the American
edition is almost always more complete, or equally complete. So that
the right to import the foreign edition of an American book, a book of
American origin, would ordinarily be confined to the Tauchnitz and the
like editions with which the gentlemen of the committee are all
familiar, where a continental publisher publishes English and American
books for the benefit of travelers, and they are not allowed to be
reimported into England or America. It seems to the publishers fair
that the same rule which applies to every Englishman and every American
as to such Tauchnitz editions should be applied to libraries; that is,
that they should get the American edition, and not the other, of which
the only advantage is cheapness, arising from its special purpose.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not these are reasonable changes has been very largely
passed upon, it seems to me, in the controversy that has gone on with
the American Library Association, which is a very powerful and very
diligent and active association, and which has been very much
interested in these matters; and in laying before you their approval of
the bill in its present shape, it seems to me that as to this clause it
must establish in the minds of the committee a clear prima facie case,
at least, that this compromise that is agreed upon is a reasonable
compromise. There are gentlemen here who represent certain libraries
who, I understand, think that it is not a reasonable compromise.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That minority is a very strong one, is it not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I think it is a strong one; and they undoubtedly
will be heard. They object that this compromise goes too far; and all
that we can reasonably ask the committee at this moment is that if it
occurs&mdash;if it seems to the committee that what this minority of
librarians have to say overcomes the presumption of fairness that
arises from a compromise satisfactory to the majority&mdash;that then the
publishers may have their opportunity of showing to the committee that
it is a fair compromise and a reasonable disposition of the matter.
</p>

<p>
Now, we come to the next clause of these exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Just an instant. Would the people you represent
object seriously to an amendment to subdivision 3, on page 16, which
would strike out all after the words "United States" where they occur?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. On page 16?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. In the tenth line of subdivision 3.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Are you reading from the printed form of the bill?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. The library print.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Section 21?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I have not compared them. I have been using the
library print all the time.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Just take the other bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Section 30 of the bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Page 24 of the Senate bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Now, strike out all after the words "United
States," in the twenty-fifth line, down to the fourth section.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I am now speaking merely for the publishers, whom I
do represent generally, and not for these other associations.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I was simply asking if the people whom you
represent would make serious objection to that amendment.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Speaking only for the publishers, I think they
would. I think they would wish to be heard fully on that before any
such change was made.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Right in that connection, let me call your
attention to the first subdivision, beginning on line 13, which deals
with the importation for an individual.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. On what page?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Page 24, line 13.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. We would understand, would we not, that that was
a practical prohibition of importations by individuals?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. No, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Do you imagine that a book would ever be imported
by an individual under that provision?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I should think they would be habitually, and to a
much larger extent than at present; and I will give you my reasons for
it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Would it not be a considerable inconvenience to
secure the permission of the proprietor of the copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I should think none at all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. We would be glad to hear you on that, because it
occurred to me that that was an absolute prohibition, in effect.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I am glad to have my attention called to this,
because this is a matter where we have not been able to make any
compromise. There are no representatives of the public who could
discuss such a compromise, and we come before the committee to submit
it to their judgment as to its fairness in the first instance.
</p>

<p>
What I want to call the attention of the committee to is that the
effect of this is simply to put the business back, as to importing one
copy, to the condition that existed before 1891 as to importing all
copies. We would be very glad, the copyright proprietors would be very
glad, and the public would be very glad if it could altogether go back
to that condition; that is, if you say books shall not be imported
without the consent of the copyright proprietor. The copyright
proprietor would then, as he did before, import books and put them into
the trade and sell them freely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Yes; the proprietor would import, but I think, in
answer to an inquiry a few moments ago, you said that under the former
law individuals did not import.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. No; but they did not need to.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Under that provision beginning on line 18, while
the proprietor might import, do you think an individual would ever
import&mdash;go to the trouble of getting the consent of the proprietor?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I think the practical working of that would be just
this&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I am only asking for information.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. The practical working would be this: Scribner &amp; Co.
would publish here a book which was also published in England. An
individual would wish to get a copy of it in the English edition, and
he would either go to the Scribners' store, or write to him, or he
would go to his bookseller, who would send word to the Scribners,
asking that a copy should be imported for that individual through Mr.
Scribner, and Scribner would import it for him. That is to say, the
individual would have far less difficulty, wherever he was situated
throughout the country, in getting the English edition of the book than
he has at present, when he himself writes to an English bookseller in
London and imports it himself.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I am not expressing any opinion at all as to the
correctness of that proposition, whether the individual should not be
prohibited from importing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. My point is that the facility with which the
individual would obtain an English edition of an American copyrighted
book would be greatly increased by the passage of this bill, because it
would put it in the regular course of business, just as it used to be
before 1891, for the owner of the American copyright to see to those
importations. The law would not allow the proprietor himself to make
the importations, but he would be exceedingly glad to import that book
for A, B, C, D, and E, all over the country, and to make it just as
easy as it was possible to do for them to get that English edition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I am not at all sure that that is not so, but I
think you agree with me that the individual himself, under that
provision, would never directly import a book.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. I think he would not.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. The proprietor would always do it for him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. It would be so much easier for him to make the
proprietor his agent, and the proprietor would be so glad to act as his
agent, and it would be so much to the interest of both parties that
that should be so that that would be naturally the course that it would
take.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hinshaw</span>. Under existing law is the proprietor of the
American copyright seriously injured by these importations?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. In ordinary cases, as I said, he is not seriously
injured&mdash;that is, in the case of popular books he is not substantially
injured at all. He does not know how much he is injured, because there
is no means of estimating the precise amount. It is an injury, but how
great he does not know.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hinshaw</span>. It is a sufficient injury, so that you think it
ought to be restricted?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. It is a sufficient injury, especially in the cases
that I have spoken of, where valuable books that cost very much to
produce and that have a limited field of sale are in question, and
there it does repeatedly prevent such books from being published in
America.
</p>

<p>
Those are the only two limitations which affect the general public
until we come to this provision of the bill which increases the term of
the copyrights in different cases. As to them, of course the main
argument is made by the producer, the author, or artist. He is the one
who wants that addition to the term, and it is a matter of no great
importance to these general organizations of reproducers whom I
represent, one or two of them permanently and some only for the moment.
But we may fairly make these observations: First, I repeat what was
very clearly put by the Librarian yesterday, that the copyright is
simply in the form of an idea, as the patent right is in the idea
itself, and that consequently there is never like oppression to the
public from the monopoly.
</p>

<p>
If I have a patent on a needle with the eye in the point, nobody in the
country can use that until my patent is out, and that is a great
oppression. If I write a book about a needle with the eye in the point,
or about anything else under the sun, my idea, for what it is worth, is
at everybody's disposal when my book is published. He can not copy my
form, but whatever good the idea does him in his own thinking or his
own work he has. That is the first consideration which has always
actuated Congress and all governments, so far as I know, in making the
copyright term much more extensive than that of the patent.
</p>

<p>
Then the next is a practical consideration which I think must be within
the knowledge of every member of the committee, and that is that for
practical purposes in most cases the public gives up nothing by
extending the term, for the reason that at the end of forty-two years a
very great majority of copyrights&mdash;I hesitate to say how large the
majority would be&mdash;has become worthless. As a matter of fact, it is
familiar to every member of the committee that people do not reproduce
books that have fallen into the public domain by the expiry of the time
of the copyright, except in very special cases of particularly popular
works. So that in most instances the public would not be giving up
anything really in adding to the end of this term a certain number of
years.
</p>

<p>
Then, next, there is the consideration that in practice it is true that
the public does now get the fullest opportunity to buy cheaply (which,
I think, must be the only interest of the public as distinguished from
the interest of the different producing classes) because books start at
a certain price and at the end of a year they go down below that price.
At the end of two years there are new editions at perhaps half the
price, and in a very few years the publisher is making every effort to
attract the public by every reduction that is possible.
</p>

<p>
There is one other consideration that I think may possibly be alluded
to, and that is that since this term was fixed, partly by the
improvements of science and partly by changes in legislation, the
actual value of a given term of copyright has diminished. Part of the
value of a term of copyright was always that at the expiration of the
term the owner of the copyright had the plates and had the books and
could compete to great advantage with other people. His right, his
privilege in that respect, has been largely taken away by these
photographic processes which have come into use. It is not necessary
for the man who wishes to publish a book to go to work and have type
set for it. He simply takes the existing edition and he photographs it,
and he does that with great cheapness. Perhaps there would be an answer
to this suggestion that the public should have the advantage that would
come from all such cheapening processes; but it seems to me that it
could reply that Congress has prohibited the copyright owner from
taking advantage of these processes, by saying that he at first must
make his book, as long as the copyright exists, in the most expensive
way, from plates made by American mechanics and who receive American
wages; and consequently that he is handicapped from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
I do not wish to press this argument unduly. It is something, it seems
to me, that may be suggested to the committee, whether or not this
committee is now to act with the same liberality which Congress showed
when the existing term was fixed, if it would not necessarily in some
degree extend the term by reason of the facts to which I have referred.
</p>

<p>
There is only one other, so far as I know, important extension of the
right of copyright contained in this bill, and on its face it appears
to be a matter of inadvertence. It is contained in section 8, where
there are provisions A and B, on page 5. The present law of copyright
allows a foreigner to take out a copyright if he is a resident in the
United States, or if he is a citizen of one of those countries which
allow similar privileges to citizens of the United States. Those are
the two categories.
</p>

<p>
At first glance at A and B, in section 8, it would appear that those
were intended to represent the same classes and to give precisely the
same rights; but, apparently by inadvertence, in the second line of
subdivision A the word which should, I think, be "and" has become "or,"
so that as it at present reads a foreigner, no matter where he lives,
no matter whether the country of which he is a citizen gives similar
rights to citizens of the United States or not, may, if he shall first
or cotemporaneously publish his work within the limits of the United
States, have a copyright. I am not here to say that that would not be a
wise extension of the law. I am not here to say on behalf of any of the
parties whom I represent that they would or would not oppose it. I do
not know anything about their views. This extension of copyright is not
an extension which has been discussed in the conference. I have no
right to give any approval of it, even to the limited extent that I
have a right to give an approval of this bill on behalf of any of these
bodies whom I represent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Would not the interest of the publishers be
safeguarded if the law provided that an individual may import one copy
of the foreign edition, but only after he has asked the proprietor of
the American copyright to buy one for him and his request has been
refused?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. If the committee chooses to put that in, I can see
no harm in it at all. It seems to me that it will result in that,
necessarily, if the American publisher is not actuated by his own
interest, as he used to be prior to 1891, and as I think he would be
again, and if he is not glad to import that copy from abroad. If he
refused I think if anybody who is aggrieved should come to Congress,
Congress would change the law instantly and compel the copyright
proprietor to give consent; and if Congress thinks it right to put in
that provision in the beginning nobody could complain. So that my
answer is that I do not think anybody would object.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span>. I would like to ask if an American citizen
traveling in Europe should at the time he was there purchase one of
these editions, would it not be a hardship on him to compel him to
forego the bringing of that copy into the United States without the
consent of the American proprietor?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Is that question addressed to me?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. If a hardship, it is inflicted by the English
custom-house at present in regard to these very Tauchnitz editions. It
is one of the few things they are rigorous about, and I think members
of this committee may have had experience with the English customs and
their rule about that. But in this bill it is provided that where there
are parts of libraries or books in baggage brought back by traveling
people they shall be admitted. I think it is a question of de minimis.
I think in the case of a man bringing back such a book it would be no
hardship worthy of the consideration of Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span>. All personal baggage is included also?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. For the information of Mr. Johnson, Mr. Chairman,
I think that Mr. Olin was referring, in answer to that question,
substantially to subsection 4, on page 25, which was supposed to take
care of the person bringing in copies in his personal baggage.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ogilvie is here from Chicago, but before his statement is made I
wish to say that, as I understood, Colonel Olin spoke in two
capacities; in the first place, giving some general expression in
behalf of a certain group of organizations, and their substantial
acquiescence in the bill; in the second place, as counsel specially for
the book publishers, with reference to certain particular provisions,
particularly this importation clause.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Olin</span>. Yes; and, finally, I wished merely to modify the
general approval of the bill which I had given on behalf of all these
organizations, by expressing my understanding that they considered the
bill, as I supposed was intended, with "and" instead of "or" in the
second line of subdivision A, in section 8, on page 5.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. In that latter capacity, the provisions of the
bill as to which Colonel Olin spoke were those as to importations
particularly affecting the interests of the libraries; and, considering
what will be most helpful to the committee, it would seem to me
appropriate, and I submit it as a suggestion, that as soon as possible
after the statement that you have had from Colonel Olin in explanation
of those provisions you have the statement from representatives here of
the group of libraries&mdash;librarians&mdash;that would dissent from the
provision. Mr. Cutter is here, and, if I understand him rightly, his
statement will be brief. Mr. Ogilvie, however, had been promised an
opportunity to be heard early this morning. As I understood him, the
oral statement that he proposes to make is an objection to certain
provisions of the bill, and that he would be content with an
opportunity for a ten-minute statement, to be supplemented, if he
chose, in writing, to go into the record.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF GEORGE W. OGILVIE, ESQ., OF CHICAGO.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, as I
understand that this bill is to take the place very largely of the
copyright act of 1891, it may be proper to refer to some of the
arguments that were advanced at that time as to why that particular
bill should pass. In furtherance of that idea, I read from The Question
of Copyright, by George Haven Putnam, on page 103, in which it is said:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
It is admitted that the proposed act or any other of a similar
nature will raise the price of the very cheap reprints of English
stories yet to be written a few cents apiece. A pamphlet of that
sort now costing 20 cents will then cost 25 cents. Of the
additional price, 2 cents will go to the author and 3 cents will go
into better paper, better print, and better binding. For the 5
cents of increased cost an American story will be furnished oftener
than an English story, an American author will get pay for his
labor, and the reader will get a book that is 100 per cent better
than the old one in paper, print, and binding.
</p>
</div>

<p>
I submit that if an additional cost of 3 cents is to go into paper,
print, and binding, and will produce a book that is 100 per cent better
than the 20-cent book, and 2 cents of the increased price is to go to
the author, that the publisher would receive no benefit whatever; and
it is well to bear in mind that the disinterested patriots who
requested the passage of the international copyright law did so for the
purpose of benefiting not themselves, but the author of a book 2 cents
per copy, and the producer of paper, printing, and binding 3 cents per
copy, out of which they got nothing. It is the same gentlemen, as I
understood it, who were sponsors for that bill who are the sponsors for
this. Twenty cents per copy for a book costing 3 cents to produce shows
a profit somewhere of 666 per cent; and it is probable that they were
satisfied with that percentage. As a basis for further remark along
that line, I desire to draw your attention to section 13 on page 6 of
the bill, as I have it here.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. That is the library copy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. It is section 13 of the third paragraph [reading]:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Any person who, for the purpose of obtaining a copyright, shall
knowingly be guilty of making a false affidavit as to his having
complied with the above conditions shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a
fine of not more than one thousand dollars, and all of his rights
and privileges under said copyright shall thereafter be forfeited.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. For whom do you appear, Mr. Ogilvie?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. For myself as a publisher and for several other
Chicago publishers, none of whom were represented at or invited to the
conferences of which this hill is the result.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Had you no notice that there was going to be a
conference?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. The first information that I had that there was a
conference was from a gentleman representing Lyon &amp; Healy, of Chicago,
in the Manhattan Hotel in New York, last November. That was the first
intimation I had that there had been a conference. I knew that there
were likely to be some, but I had no notice of their dates.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. We wanted you as well as everybody else.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. I knew nothing about it. I may say, also, that
the first draft of this bill that I have seen was received in my office
in Chicago Saturday morning last.
</p>

<p>
Again, on page 18 of the bill, section 25:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That any person who willfully and for profit shall infringe any
copyright secured by this act, or who shall knowingly or willfully
aid or abet such infringement or in any wise knowingly and
willfully take part in any such infringement shall be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by
imprisonment for not exceeding one year or by a fine, etc.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It seems to me a little out of order for the gentlemen who are sponsors
for this bill to make it possible for them to get a copyright on a
book, and if they are not caught in making a false affidavit in
securing it, that a man shall go to the penitentiary for a year for
pirating that particular book. It will be rather difficult for one to
prove, after a number of years, that a publisher who has made an
affidavit to secure a copyright to which he really was not entitled had
committed perjury in connection with the securing of that copyright;
but the question as to one's piracy of the book is open and "he that
runs may read." It seems to me that there is a punishment there that
they have applied to the wrong crime. If the man who makes a false
affidavit were to go to the penitentiary for the year, I think it would
protect the interests that desire protection in this country, in the
form of labor, in the matter of setting up and manufacturing books
wholly within the limits of the United States.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do I understand you to contend that the
Librarian should be charged with any special duty in that regard, for
the registry of the copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. No, sir; the Librarian can not determine whether
a man is making a false or correct affidavit, but if one makes a false
affidavit he is the man who should go to the penitentiary and not the
individual who pirates his book.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. Does not section 13 provide that the man who
makes the affidavit shall be guilty of a misdemeanor?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes; and the penalty therein provided is, "he
shall be fined not exceeding one thousand dollars." That is all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. What is your suggestion?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. That you change the punishment.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. And make it a penitentiary offense?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Let them both go to the penitentiary, if either
one goes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. In both cases?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. In both cases, if necessary. Do not eliminate the
publisher. I am a publisher, but if I have made a false affidavit,
there is no reason why the man who pirates my book should go to the
penitentiary and I should only have to pay a fine, if I am caught. I
see no reason why a man should go to the penitentiary in either case,
really. He may unwittingly infringe the copyright of a book.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. This says "willfully."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. That is subject to the construction of the
courts. We all know what that means.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. No; it puts the burden of proof on the Government
to show it beyond a reasonable doubt.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. The proof of the perjury should also be beyond a
reasonable doubt and the one guilty of it should be equally punished.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. If he did it unwittingly it would not be willful,
you know.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. It is impossible for a publisher to make an
"unwitting" affidavit of that sort. The publisher knows where the
article that he is publishing is manufactured. I have been a publisher
for a great many years, and I know where the articles that I am turning
out are manufactured. It is possible for him to make an affidavit that
is literally and absolutely true in regard to the place of manufacture
of every article that he produces.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Where he willfully makes a false affidavit it
is equivalent to perjury, and the penalty for that is generally
imprisonment in the penitentiary.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Then why change the penalty in this law? It
certainly limits his liability under this act.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. There is not any liability at all. No affidavit
is required. There is no penalty for a false statement at all under the
law now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Not as it is at present, but as this new law
proposes it there is a liability.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. This was a bill that passed the House last winter
and was not reached in the Senate.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Well, the facts are here.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. It was reported favorably by the Senate
committee.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Yes; and not reached.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Section 19, the last portion of that section,
reads:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>And provided further</i>, That should such subsisting copyright
have been assigned, or a license granted therein for publication
upon payment of royalty, the copyright shall be renewed and
extended only in case the assignee or licensee shall join in the
application for such renewal and extension.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. That provides for the extension of the existing
copyright for an additional term.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. What is your suggestion on that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. That the gentlemen who framed this bill, and who
wished to let themselves out of the penitentiary for committing
perjury, would be likely to make a very liberal arrangement with the
author, or his widow or children, if it was within his power to refuse
to consent to a renewal of a copyright. He may have been paying a
royalty of 20 per cent, and when the time came for securing a renewal
of the copyright he would be likely to say, "I will give you 1 per
cent, and if you do not agree to that I will not join the request for
an extension of the copyright." I think that is wholly beyond the
province of this act.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Whose consent should be required?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Eliminate the publisher. He has no concern with
it. The Constitution does not grant him any rights under the copyright
law. He is not the "inventor" or the "author." Eliminate the publisher
wholly, unless you desire, in case there may be an investment there
that the publisher desires to protect, to let the author take care of
that by contract, so that at the expiration of the copyright the
publisher may have the right to continue the publication on the payment
of the same royalty.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Can you suggest an amendment to carry out your
idea in the matter?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Unless the publisher shall agree to pay at least the same royalty
for an extension of the copyright as has been paid during the
previous years, the author shall have the sole right to apply for
and secure an extension of copyright.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You are really talking against your own interests
as a publisher just now?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. I am, absolutely, talking against my interests as
a publisher.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Do you contend that this provision would apply
where the publisher had no interest in the publication beyond the
ordinary time of copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. That is all; it shall apply only to that case.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. I construe this provision in here to be just what
you say.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. No; I read it differently from the way you do,
and place a different construction upon it. We will again refer to it
and see if I am wrong. If I am wrong, I shall be glad to be put right,
and if you are wrong, I know that you will be glad to be put right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. It says here unless the assignee or licensee shall
join in the application. If a man is an assignee or licensee he has an
interest in the copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. He takes it for the time limit only.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. If he is not he has no interest, and would not
have to join with the widow or children in this application for an
extension of the copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. But if he is the assignee or licensee then he is
interested in it only during the life of the copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. I do not understand it that way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hinshaw</span>. How could the licensee have any interest in the
copyright beyond the life of it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. He would have an interest in it so far as it could
be extended.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Why should he?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. He has not. There is no provision now for the
extension, and he would not have, except as he might get it under this
bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. He would provide for that in his contract.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes. Leave it out of the law.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. When the assignment was made, he would provide
for all extensions.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. That is right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hinshaw</span>. Are these contracts for royalty made to include a
possible extension of the copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Not generally; because the author may be dead
when the time for the renewal comes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. But it can be renewed then by his widow.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. But they do not do it generally.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I should suppose that in almost all cases under
the existing law they would get a renewal.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. They do at times, but not often.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. I think I understand what you mean, and that is
this: That where there is no subsisting contract, then that the
publisher shall not join&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. The publishers shall not be required to join.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span> (continuing). In the application for the renewal of
the copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes. As this is, it makes it impossible for the
author or his widow or children to secure the extension of the
copyright without the licensee joining. Then he has it in his power to
diminish the royalty paid to suit his own purpose.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. If the contract for the copyright does not
provide as between the author and the publisher for any renewal, what
position would you be in then?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. According to this law it is impossible to get a
renewal unless the licensee joins in the request.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. The license expires&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. But the license does not expire until after the
copyright expires.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. What is the length of your contract that you
usually make?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. This is a new provision entirely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Under the old law, I mean?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Under the old law it usually lasts as long as the
copyright lasts.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You suggest that we leave out this last proviso
absolutely?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. Not to leave it out absolutely&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. I think it should be left out altogether. It is
wholly unfair to an author. I can see no reason why the publisher
should have any right of that kind. The Constitution grants the right
to an author, and if the publisher desires to secure those rights that
is a matter of contract. Let him make a contract covering that point.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hinshaw</span>. If the copyright had been assigned, the original
proprietor would have lost all interest in the copyright; would he not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. The party who now takes a copyright takes it with
the understanding that it shall expire at a certain time; and then he
is in no better position and no worse than any other publisher who has
not had a contract with the author.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Suppose your contracts under this bill, should it
become a law, should provide for the life of the copyright, together
with any extensions thereof&mdash;then what would you say as to the proviso?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Suppose the bill should provide for the life of
the contract, together with any extension thereof?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Suppose under this bill, should it become a law,
your contracts with the author should provide for the license and
assignment to extend the copyright during its life and all extensions
thereof?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. If the author wishes to make a contract of that
sort, that is the author's business; but let the author thoroughly
understand what he is doing. As it is here, the author may think he is
entitled to the license for a renewal term, whereas he finds the
publisher has it wholly within his hands. The publisher is not entitled
to it; it is not his.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. After all, it resolves itself down to a mere
question of contract?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes; but this eliminates the necessity for making
a contract, because this gives certain people rights.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Only where there is a subsisting contract,
however.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. But the contract as at present expressed is for
the life of that copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. The life is fourteen years?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Twenty-eight and fourteen. Now, then, let us
assume, under this section, that a copyright expires next year. Let us
assume that this bill passes, that a copyright expires next year, and
that I am the author of a certain book. I go to my publisher and say:
"Here under the law I am entitled to a renewal of the copyright for my
book for a term of fifty years in all, or during my life, or whatever
the term may be." The publisher replies: "Very well; you want me to
join in the securing of that extension, do you?" "Yes." "Well, I have
been paying you 20 per cent royalty; I will pay you 2 per cent
hereafter, and if you do not take that I will pay you nothing." Is it
impossible to suppose that some publishers would do that when they
carefully provide against going to the penitentiary for committing
perjury? I think not.
</p>

<p>
Another point: in section 15, in the last paragraph, this language
appears:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Where the copyright proprietor has sought to comply with the
requirements of this act as to notice, and the notice has been duly
affixed to the bulk of the edition published, its omission by
inadvertence from a particular copy or copies, though preventing
recourse against an innocent infringer without notice, shall not
invalidate the copyright.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, let us see where that lands us. How have the public any means of
determining whether "the bulk" of the books has contained a notice of
copyright? Assume that I get hold of a book that contains no notice of
copyright, and as a publisher I reprint it. It may have been an
expensive book to reprint. It may have cost me several thousand
dollars. What provision is there in this law to reimburse me for having
innocently done that which, under the law, apparently I had a perfect
right to do? Not any. I think there should be some provision to
reimburse a man who does a thing of that kind under an apparent right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. This is not a case of ignorance of the law; you
think it is a case of ignorance of fact?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Ignorance of fact. You are not obligated at
present to go to the Copyright Office to ask any questions. The book
itself is supposed to present all evidence of existing copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Could you not obtain that information at the
office of the Librarian?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. In regard to that as arranged at present, just to
illustrate the point, I will state that I printed a book in Chicago, an
English book, apparently published in England, containing no notice of
American copyright. I spent several thousand dollars in getting the
book out, and have spent several thousand dollars since then in
lawyers' fees. The point was this: The book was published under one
title in the United States and under another title in Great Britain. It
contained no notice of American copyright.
</p>

<p>
In an excess of caution I communicated with the Librarian of Congress
asking whether a copyright existed on that particular book, by title,
in either the name of the English publisher or the name of an American
publisher, whose name also happened to be on the title-page of the
book; and I was informed that no copyright existed. I reproduced the
book. Judge Kohlsaat, in the Federal circuit court of Chicago, decided
that I was strictly within my rights. The circuit court of appeals
reversed his decision and has refused a rehearing, and we must,
consequently, take the matter to the Supreme Court. Now, I claim that
under the law a man who does that is entitled to compensation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Excuse me just a minute, Mr. Ogilvie; will you
permit, Mr. Chairman, the register to say a word?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Certainly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. It is simply in answer to Mr. Ogilvie's intimation
that he answered his inquiry, and that his inquiry was whether a
copyright existed upon that book. What was the answer that he got from
the office of copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. The only purpose in making any remark on that
point is that there shall not be a misunderstanding as to the nature of
the replies to such inquiries. Any matter of fact on record in the
copyright office is always at the disposal of any inquirer, but the
copyright office is very careful not to undertake to state the
termination of any copyright. It simply gives facts as to the
registration of title or whether it has discovered any. In fact, it is
very careful not to say even that there is no registration, but that
the indices of the office and the records of the office after careful
search do not disclose any.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Mr. Ogilvie is substantially right in his
statement, then.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. And at this time I wish to publicly thank Mr.
Solberg and Mr. Putnam for the uniform courtesy with which they reply
to all inquiries that are addressed to their office. The gentleman is
quite right. That was exactly the phraseology used in his reply. But
that, I beg to submit, is the only source of information that
publishers have; and when they get that sort of information they are
justified in proceeding along lines indicated thereby.
</p>

<p>
I say that every edition of a book that is copyrighted under the United
States law should contain notice of copyright, irrespective of where it
may be printed, and thus give the public due notice.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Let me ask you in regard to that instance
that you speak of in your experience. That book had two different
titles, you say?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. That is, there was an English publication
under one title and an American publication under a different title?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Were they identically the same book?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. No; not identically the same book, even.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Which title did you publish under?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Under the English title.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Was the subject-matter different?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. The subject-matter was different. A portion of
it, consisting of some 500 pages, was alike, but a considerable portion
of it was different.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hinshaw</span>. The English book was copyrighted in the United
States?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. The American book was copyrighted in the United
States. The English book contained no notice of copyright, and I may go
further and say&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Did you publish the English book?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. We published the English book. I may go further
and say that the American publisher, by contract, agreed to the
elimination of the American copyright mark; and he did that for this
reason: The people who live in Great Britain refuse to buy, if they can
avoid it, American books. I have had opportunities to sell several
thousand copies of my copyright books, provided I would leave out of
them the American copyright notice. I have in my office in Chicago at
the present time a great number of American copyright books that have
been printed in the United States and sold to publishers in Great
Britain, who required the elimination of the American copyright notice;
and the American publishers were foolish enough to comply with that
request, thereby, in my humble judgment, vitiating their copyright. I
say that in the case of an American copyright book the public are
entitled to be informed, not merely by the insertion of the word
"copyright," but by the insertion of the word "copyright," together
with the date on which the copyright was taken out and the name of the
person who took it out, exactly as the law is at present. It is not
enough to simply substitute the word "copyright;" it means nothing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Suppose in the case you have referred to you
began to publish this book without any knowledge that it was protected
by copyright? Could you not go right on and publish and sell that book?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. The courts have enjoined me.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. If this law is passed, could you not do that? Let
me read it. (Reading:)
</p>

<p>
"It's omission"&mdash;that is, notice of copyright&mdash;"by inadvertence from a
particular copy or copies, though preventing recourse against an
innocent infringer without notice."
</p>

<p>
You are an innocent infringer; you can go right along and dispose of
the books. That is your case; that is your defense in any proceeding
against you for selling these books.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. But it does not invalidate the copyright as
against all others, nor prevent recovery for an infringement against
any person who, after actual notification of the copyright, begins an
undertaking to infringe it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Well, will you tell me what this means&mdash;"shall
not invalidate the copyright?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Why, the copyright exists as against everybody
but you in that edition of the book.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Very well, if that is the case.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. But if this bill passes, you would have a right
to go on and complete the edition of the book and sell it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. If that is the construction that the courts give
it, very well.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. There can not be any doubt about the
construction. It is only the man who, after actual notice that the
copyright exists, begins an undertaking to infringe it who is affected.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. I read that section very carefully, and I see the
point that you raise; but I could not&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I think this gives you full protection.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. I could not get over the statement, however, that
it did not invalidate the copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. But it does not invalidate the copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. As applied to everybody else?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. To anybody who has notice before he begins.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Very well. Now, then, with regard to the
insertion of notice, to get back to the subject, I consider that the
insertion of the notice is essential. If we are ashamed of the United
States, if we must cater to England, and France, and Germany, and other
nations by the elimination of a notice that indicates the origin of our
books, why do we desire to protect their authors?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Oh, this omission that is referred to is a mere
inadvertence in a particular copy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I understand now, Mr. Chairman, if you will permit
me, Mr. Ogilvie, it is in aid of your statement&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I understand now that Mr. Ogilvie is referring to
the requirement as to the notice being in terms limited to the edition
sold in the United States.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. And it does not extend to any edition that may be
produced and sold abroad?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I understand that you think that it ought to be on
all authorized editions of books?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. All authorized editions. The copyright law says
that the notice shall go on the title-page or the page immediately
following. You turn to any book, and what do you find on the page
immediately following? Practically nothing, unless the copyright notice
is there. There is plenty of room for it. If they can engrave the
Lord's prayer on a three-cent silver piece, there is certainly room
enough to put those half dozen words on the back of their title-page.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the publication of books under two titles, it seems to me
that some provision should be made in the law to protect a man who
publishes a book that is printed abroad under one title and is printed
in this country under another, provided the foreign edition does not
contain notice of copyright. As it is to-day, and as it will be under
this law, one can import a book printed in England; it may have been
written on the same subject as that which you intended to produce a
book on; you have carefully warned your editors to abstain from making
extracts from a book that is printed in this country or that contains a
notice of copyright. You proceed. Your editor finds a book in a library
that does not contain notice of United States copyright. It is
published abroad by a publisher different from the one who issues it
here. There is nothing to warn him. He makes copious extracts, and the
owner of the copyright may be perfectly well aware of the fact that he
has made those extracts. Under this law as it is proposed, he may
permit that infringement to continue for three years and then claim
damages, not less than one dollar a copy, although the book may have
been sold for 10 cents per copy, and practically put the apparently
infringing publisher, who acted in perfect good faith, out of business.
It is unjust; and I submit, gentlemen, that those matters are proper
subjects for consideration, and that they should not be enacted into a
law in their present form.
</p>

<p>
Now, to refer to some of the remarks made by my predecessor, Mr. Olin.
He said that the American Publishers' Copyright League and the American
Publishers' Association represented practically all of the publishers
of the United States. I differ distinctly and materially with him. They
do not. They represent a few and only a few of the publishers of the
United States. I doubt very much if a single publisher west of the
Alleghenies (with very few exceptions) is a member of either of those
associations. There may be a few exceptions&mdash;I know now that there
are&mdash;but very few, and he is not qualified to speak for the others who
are not members of those associations, and they do not represent a
majority.
</p>

<p>
In regard to importation, he said that Scribner would be very glad to
import a book if he were requested to do so. Now, I am a publisher, and
if it were my book I do not think I should be very glad. I think I
should tell the intending purchaser that I had a copy of the book that
was at his disposal for the fixed price that I had placed upon it, and
I think Scribner would do likewise.
</p>

<p>
In regard to cheap editions, which he spoke of and said that at the end
of the copyright a publisher was desirous of securing as large a
circulation as possible for his books&mdash;that is true within a year or
two of the end of the term of copyright. But I can not recall at this
moment a single book the price of which has been reduced materially
until so close to the end of the term of copyright as to make it
practically valueless to the original publisher unless he did reduce
the price; and he does it, not for love of the public, not because he
is considering the public, but simply to get ahead of his
fellow-publisher. He is the man who then has a couple of years in which
to exploit a cheap edition; and it seems to me that under the law as it
is suggested, a term of fifty years from the date of the death of the
youngest of the authors is going beyond what the framers of the
Constitution decided was a limited time. Let us assume that Mark Twain,
if he were 80 years of age, were to write a book. He has his daughter,
who may be 20, write a few lines in that same book. Mark Twain dies in
a few years; she lives to be 90. There is seventy years of copyright,
and fifty years after her death, making one hundred and twenty years. I
do not believe that that is a "limited time" within the meaning of the
phraseology of the Constitution. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That is the joint-author clause.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ogilvie</span>. There is just one point that I had overlooked. I
was not at any of the conferences, but I have been informed that an
attorney representing certain of the special interests at those
conferences suggested that the public should be considered; and to
quote literally what I was told as to what happened, "he was hooted at
and laughed down." And I think that very fully expresses the sentiment
contained in this proposed copyright act, so far as the public are
concerned.
</p>

<p>
I thank you, gentlemen.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF FRANK H. SCOTT, ESQ., PRESIDENT OF THE CENTURY COMPANY,
NEW YORK, AND PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS' ASSOCIATION.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. Mr. Chairman, I only wish to clear up two points
that have been raised by my predecessor. I am not responsible for the
exact wording of the clauses covering these two points, but I do wish
to emphasize their importance.
</p>

<p>
The first is as to the question of the original publisher's rights at
the termination of the present contract or the present copyright. Under
the law as it now stands, at the termination of the copyright the
publisher would have a set of plates and possibly a large number of
books on hand. He can enter the market, no matter who comes into the
field, and compete on at least equal conditions.
</p>

<p>
Under the bill as it is proposed now, if the author secures a
continuation or a renewal of his copyright, and the publisher is not
consulted the publisher would be left with his set of plates and his
investment in the sheets and stock; and it would be absolutely
impossible for him to sell them to anybody, because his contract having
expired, and the author may have gone and made a new contract with a
new publisher, leaving him entirely out of it. If there is no copyright
whatever he can compete on equal terms.
</p>

<p>
I am only explaining why I think the publisher ought to have some
consideration under those circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. What do you say to the amendment suggested by the
gentleman who last spoke?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. Just what was that amendment?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That the publisher might have the right to
control the extended term, provided he would pay the same royalty that
he had paid.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. I think the publisher ought to be obliged to pay
the same royalty that anyone else should pay at that time. It might be
a very old work. It might be that the time during which he could
continue to pay that royalty had expired.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You could hardly set the right up at auction,
could you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. I am sorry to say it is very often done.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Would you not think that would give the publisher
an undue advantage over the author?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. I think the law as it is at present framed is very
broad. I only wish to say now that I think the publisher ought to be
consulted. I suppose this will come up later, and I have not prepared
any argument on the subject. I am only pleading that the publisher
ought to have some consideration under those circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Can not the publisher provide against all that by
the contract he makes?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. There will be no trouble about the copyrights taken
out after the passage of this bill. It is only with reference to
copyrights that are now in existence.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. You think the language of the bill as it is is
too broad?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. I think so. I think I should not have made it,
myself, quite so broad.
</p>

<p>
The other point I wish to make is with reference to the publication of
the American copyright notice in editions of an American copyright work
which are published abroad. What the gentleman has said might be very
true if the matter were always within the control of the publisher of
the American edition, but, as you will readily see, it is not always
within his control. These books are very often written by a foreign
author. The contracts of the foreign author, for instance, in the case
of English novels, are made with his own publisher in London. They have
their own arrangement between themselves as to what notice shall be put
in the book. The American publisher is forced to place in his own books
published in this country the American copyright notice, but he has no
control as to what notice shall be placed upon books published in
Germany, or in France, or in Spain, or in Russia, or in England. It is
entirely beyond his control.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Would you think the terms of this bill, then, are
right?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. I should say the terms of this bill are right. It
seems to me it is perfectly possible for anyone desiring to reprint a
book in the United States to ascertain whether or not it is
copyrighted. Indeed, the general facts about any book which is so
important that anyone wishes to reprint it are notorious. It is known
or it can be easily ascertained whether the book is published in the
United States and whether it is copyrighted in the United States or
not. And I do not think that anyone should be able to get hold of a
single copy, whether printed abroad or printed in the United States,
that does not happen to have the copyright notice, and be permitted to
go ahead and reprint the book <i>ad libitum</i>. I think the rights of
the owner would not be sufficiently protected if that were permitted.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. What do you say about the case of the gentleman
who just preceded you&mdash;the lawsuit into which he got himself?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. That has been determined in the courts; it is not
for me to say. One judge decided that he was right, and the judge to
whom the case was appealed decided that he was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. He seems to have made all the necessary effort to
find out whether there was a copyright or not.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span>. That book, as I happen to know, was an edition of
one of the dictionaries, otherwise known as Webster's Dictionary. I
think it was perfectly easy for him to find out whether that book was
copyrighted in the United States or not. It is not for me to say
whether there was any technical omission which endangered the copyright
under the language of the present statute; but it does seem to me that
in books generally published outside of the realm of the United States,
and beyond the jurisdiction of the United States, it should not be
necessary for the American publisher, who owns the copyright or who
represents the owner of the copyright, to go abroad and undertake to
make arrangements of this kind. It might be very difficult for him to
make arrangements for the publication of the American copyright notice
on foreign editions which he does not print himself and which he does
not arrange to control.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Mr. Chairman, I want to make a suggestion about
the form of expression of that clause on page 12. You will notice that
in the last line of that second paragraph of section 15 the word
"undertaking" is used. I do not know whether people generally
understand the use of that word "undertaking" as lawyers in my part of
the country do, but I would prefer the word "action" rather than
"undertaking," because "undertaking" usually refers to a bond of some
kind. "Action," it seems to me, is the proper word.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. That is page 12, line 18, is it not, Mr. Chaney?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Yes. The word "undertaking," you know, is used by
lawyers generally in the sense of a bond or some agreement to stand
good for the default of another, whereas "action" is the name of the
suit.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. This was not intended to apply to a legal action.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. But is it not in the same nature?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. No; it was simply meant to apply to the beginning
of some enterprise, the beginning to prepare to manufacture. It is a
business undertaking, not a legal one.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I misunderstood it, then.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. That is what I understood it to be&mdash;an
enterprise.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You might let the two words go out, so it would
read, "who, after notification of the copyright, begins to infringe
it." Then it would be a question of fact.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman, you have asked me to announce that
it will be the desire of the committee to have the names and addresses
of all those present at these hearings, and the relations in which, if
they desire to express it, they are here, whether in favor of or in
opposition to the bill. We have provided a register at the door in
which those names can be noted. I understand that it is desired that
that shall extend to all those present.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. All present, and in such form that it may be
placed in the record that we are making.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You mean also to include, I suppose, a brief
expression from these people as to their objections, and to what their
objections related?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Yes. The register will be supplemented by their
communications, I suppose&mdash;the register itself, including their names.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Horace Pettit, Mr. Chairman, who spoke yesterday, desires to
supplement his remarks with an additional suggestion or two, which he
has put in writing, and asks simply to have entered in the record, with
your permission.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Lewandowski, present here, asks me to submit a request in
writing from a firm of music publishers in New York, that he submit to
you a communication in aid of the provisions for the protection of
music publishers against reproduction by mechanical devices. He submits
that in writing, with the request that it may be entered on the record.
</p>

<p>
(The various papers above mentioned will be found at the end of this
statement of Mr. Putnam.)
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. The copyright office, Mr. Chairman, is now in
receipt, naturally, since the bill has been introduced, of some
suggestions from those who have participated in the conferences, and
since the bill has been introduced and is in the custody of your
committee it would seem that those belong to the files of your
committee. If you will permit me, I will submit these, without reading
them, to be entered in the record.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do you think they ought to be printed in the
record of the meeting?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I do, Mr. Chairman. I do not refer to mere formal
communications, or those that may be disposed of absolutely by the
copyright office. I do not mean all communications that come to us with
reference to the bill. These are simply four communications, from four
participants in the conference. One of them, Mr. A. W. Elson, makes
certain definite proposals for amendments, including one to section 13
which would extend the manufacturing clause. He has sent a copy of this
to you, Mr. Chairman, and I assume that it will go in the record, with
the request for a hearing.
</p>

<p>
The second is from Mr. Edmund C. Stedman, who was a participant, but is
in ill-health, and can not be here; but it contains an expression upon
the bill that I think should go in the record.
</p>

<p>
Another is from Mr. Leo Feist, also a participant, and contains an
expression about the bill that he would have made here orally if
present. I think that should go in.
</p>

<p>
Another is from Mr. Ansley Wilcox, who represented certain lithographic
interests very much concerned with the protection of such prints as
posters, and very much concerned, therefore, in the specifications of
subject-matter. He writes a communication which I think should go into
the record, expressing his content with the specifications of sections
4 and 5.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Those will be printed in the record.
</p>

<p>
(The above-mentioned papers will also be found at the end of this
statement of Mr. Putnam.)
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I have information, Mr. Chairman, that when the
matter of the reproduction of music by mechanical devices comes up for
discussion, Mr. John J. O'Connell, an attorney of New York, would like
to be heard, representing ten manufacturers of automatic piano players
in New York City, and desiring to be heard only in opposition to those
portions of the bill respecting musical copyrights, and that in
connection with the same general subject-matter Mr. Howlett Davis, an
inventor of material that enters into these devices, desires an
opportunity to make some opening remarks, pointing out how the proposed
bill will, if enacted, act in restraint of invention, and show how it
encroaches upon the existing patent laws.
</p>

<p>
If it is your pleasure, now, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that it
would be helpful to have an expression from the librarians dissenting
from the assent of the American Library Association with regard to the
importation clause, while Colonel Olin's remarks are fresh in mind, and
if that is your pleasure, I think it is only fair that I should make
clear the status of that provision.
</p>

<p>
The list of participants in the conference included two associations
that might be interested or were certain to be interested in these
importation provisions. One was the National Educational Association
and the other the American Library Association. These importation
clauses concededly contain a restriction, a limitation, a diminution of
existing privileges of importations enjoyed by individuals and enjoyed
by certain institutions.
</p>

<p>
The National Educational Association might well have spoken for both
individuals and institutions and generally. As a matter of fact, it
should be clear that the participation of the National Educational
Association in the conferences was of the slightest. They were invited,
we urged them to be represented, and they were present by delegate at
the first and the second conferences; but their participation was of
the slightest. There was no expression from them upon the diminution in
the case of individuals, and they contented themselves at the outset
with an expression of dissent from any provisions which tended to
diminish in any way the present privileges of libraries.
</p>

<p>
The American Library Association was present by two accredited
delegates, who considered, by later action of the representative board
of the association, that they had authority to represent the
association in assenting to final provisions. Those two delegates were
the present president of the American Library Association, Mr. Frank P.
Hill, of the Brooklyn Public Library, and Mr. Frank C. Bostwick, of the
New York Public Library. Mr. Bostwick was here yesterday, but has had
to leave to-day. Colonel Olin's remarks included the American Library
Association as one of those associations for whom he could give a
general assent to the bill substantially as it stood. Coupled with
that, however, should, I think, be before you this entry in the record
of our conference in March last. At that conference these provisions
were, I believe, substantially (as far as they regarded libraries) as
they stand in the bill, except that one proviso has been added, which
is rather in favor of libraries, as we understand it, than otherwise.
They expressed themselves then thus:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hill</span>. There is very little that I need to say. The
paragraph relating to the copyright respecting the libraries has
been taken up very carefully by the executive board and the council
and by the delegates, and we are satisfied as an association with
the draft as submitted, and, personally, I approve of the change
which has been agreed to this morning between the publishers and
the delegates. That related to the additional proviso that they
should not be prohibited from importing foreign editions in these
exceptional cases, where they could not get the American edition.
</p>

<p>
I think it is only fair to state, Mr. Librarian, that while the
executive board and the council of the American Library Association
have both voted for the adoption of this draft there will be
individual opposition. There are some librarians and some libraries
that are opposed to any change in any part of the law which affects
importation, and so have reserved the right to oppose that part of
the bill. I think it is due to you that such statement may be made,
so that you may know the individual opinion as well as the general
one.
</p>
</div>

<p>
If Mr. Bostwick had been here, he would to-day have called attention to
that. I do it simply because those delegates are not here to say that;
and I do it in order to give Mr. Cutter's remarks a proper standing
before you. Mr. Cutter, as I understand it, represents librarians and
libraries who object to any diminution of the present privileges.

<p>
<span class="sc">Gentlemen</span>: Referring to the proposed bill to amend and
consolidate the acts respecting copyright, now before the

</p>

<p>
Amend section 3 (p. 3, line 8) by adding continuously at the end of
said section the following:
</p>

<p>
"<i>And provided</i>, That no devices, contrivances, or appliances,
or dies, or matrices for making the same, such as referred to in
clause (g), section 1, made prior to the date this act shall go
into effect, shall be subject to any subsisting copyright."
</p>

<p>
Amend section 5 (p. 4, lines 2 to 3) by adding, between lines 2 and
3, before the word "photographs," the following: "(j)
talking-machine records."
</p>

<p>
Amend section 18, clause (b) (p. 14, line 14), by adding, between
the word "composition" and the word "any," the words "any
talking-machine record;"
</p>

<p>
Amend section 23 by striking out from the clause marked "First" (p.
17, lines 18 to 20) the following: "or any device especially
adapted to reproduce to the ear any copyrighted work."
</p>

<p>
Amend section 23 by inserting in the clause marked "Fourth" (p. 18,
line 4), between the words "of" and "all," the following: "any
device, contrivance, or appliance mentioned in section 1, clause
(g) and".
</p>

<p>
Hoping that these proposed amendments will meet with the approval
of the committee, I remain,

<hr class="tiny">

<p>
<i>To the Committee of the Senate on Patents, Senator Alfred B.
Kittredge, of South Dakota, Chairman.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gentlemen</span>: I appear before you this morning in the name
and as the representative of the firm of Jos. W. Stern &amp; Co., music
publishers, of New York, and in their behalf I wish to state that
the bill on copyrights S. 6330, to amend and consolidate the acts
representing copyrights, which is before you this morning, is of
the highest importance, for the protection of the authors and
composers and music publishers, to protect their copyrights.
</p>

<p>
The old law is very vague and unsatisfactory. The proposed new law
would help music publishers and composers very much.
</p>

<p>
There has been a great deal of piracy going on and their best
"hits" have been copied and pirated.
</p>

<p>
The new law makes such piracy a criminal offense, punishable by
fine or a year imprisonment. If passed, as we hereby most humbly
pray that it should be so, it will punish the pirates, because the
fine alone can not stop their unjust deeds, and they laugh and pay
their fine, but a year of imprisonment will certainly change all
for the best. The said pirate would not risk a year of prison at
all times.
</p>

<p>
Then again, the new law provides that no phonograph company or any
makers of musical instruments, as well as makers of self-playing
pianos, can deliberately use the work of the brain of the composer
as well as the property of the publisher without permission to do
so or paying some remuneration for the same.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the injustice of the thing. A composer writes a song or an
opera. A publisher buys at great expense the rights to the same and
copyrights it.
</p>

<p>
Along comes the phonographic companies and companies who cut music
rolls and deliberately steal the work of the brain of the composer
and publisher without any regard for the said publisher's or
composer's rights.
</p>

<p>
They sell thousands and thousands of the "hits" of the publisher,
which he has worked hard to make, without paying, as stated before,
a cent of royalty for them.
</p>

<p>
The new law proposed remedies this, but of course the phonographic
companies are fighting the new bill tooth and nail.
</p>

<p>
In this brief outline I shall include another important statement
to show how much work, and anxiety of the brain a composer must use
to write something in poetry or music, and what anxiety and worry
he endures until the said "hit" is an accomplished fact. Sometimes
his entire family depends upon the publishing of this brain work,
and when it is accepted and the publisher issues the same for the
public's appreciation, behold, in the next few days every sort of
instrument is playing this man's composition.
</p>

<p>
I for one have suffered this injustice and piracy. Therefore I feel
how dreadful it is in general to suffer and to be deprived of
remuneration for the just and intelligent inventive brain work
which a man produces by his genius.
</p>

<p>
This is, gentlemen, an excellent opportunity to show fair play to a
body of citizens who have been working at a disadvantage and
fighting for years for their just rights and for proper and
adequate protection from the Government. I conclude by appealing
most earnestly and respectfully to the honorable gentlemen of the
committee to do their utmost to forward the passage of this bill,
and I am convinced that they will earn everlasting thanks and
gratitude for creating a law which will earn for them recognition
and will carry their name to history for having worked for the
advancement of an industry which has been sorely oppressed by
piracy and injustice.
</p>

<p>
Believing that my most humble indorsement of this new law and the
desire of the firm of Jos. W. Stern &amp; Co., who have authorized me
to address this body in their behalf, will soon be upon the statute
books protecting copyright, I have the honor to remain,

<p>

<p>
<i>Suggestions of additions and amendments to the copyright bill
introduced before Congress May 31, 1906, entitled "A bill to amend and
consolidate the acts respecting copyright."</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Section 5 (subsection J).</i>&mdash;That the words "and negatives" be
added after the word "photographs," so that subsection J shall read:
"Photographs and negatives."
</p>

<p>
Negatives are made the subject of copyright under the present copyright
law, and there seems to be no valid reason why they should be omitted
in the new copyright statute. It would very much simplify the
copyrighting of all photographic reproductions if negatives were made
the subject of copyright, and for the purpose of registration two
prints of the negative copyrighted should be filed in the copyright
office. I would therefore suggest that the following words be added to
section 11, seventh line, after the word "edition," "or if the work be
a negative, two prints made directly from it."
</p>

<p>
<i>Section 13.</i>&mdash;In this section typesetting and the lithographic
process are singled out from all other processes connected with the
manufacture of printed books, and given distinct protection from
foreign competition over all other processes in making books that are
copyrightable in the United States. Any such discrimination is unjust,
and if this section is retained, the protection should be broadened to
include any other processes besides lithography.
</p>

<p>
I would therefore suggest that section 13 be amended as follows: After
the words "lithographic process," in the seventh line, and after the
same words on page 6, first line, nineteenth line, and thirtieth line,
there be inserted the words "or any other process or method," and after
the words "a process," in the same line, the words "or method."
</p>

<p>
That the word "lithographs" in the second and third lines of the same
page be erased, and the word "illustrations" be inserted in place of
it; and on the same page, in the third line of that portion of section
13 on that page that the words "where" and "either" be erased. My
preference would be to see the whole section dropped out, but failing
in this no undue preference should be shown any one or two methods
connected with the manufacture of books.
</p>

<p>
<i>Section 39.</i>&mdash;In its present form could be made clearer if it is
intended to secure to an author of an original work of the fine arts
any copyright which he may have obtained under the statutes on his
work. On the other hand, if the section is intended to secure to an
author or artist any potential copyright in a work on which he had not
duly secured statutory copyright, then such provision, it would seem,
would be unreasonable and unjust to the purchaser of the work; and I
would therefore suggest the following wording for this section: "The
author of any original work of the fine arts being the owner of such a
work and having copyrighted it according to the provisions of this act
or any previous United States copyright act, and who has marked upon
such original work such notice of copyright as may be required by the
act under which the work was copyrighted, shall not be deemed to sell
or transfer said copyright upon selling or transferring the original
work of art unless an agreement in writing covering the transfer of
said copyright be signed by the author."
</p>

<p>
<i>Section 37.</i>&mdash;Is open to the same criticism as section 39. It
might be corrected by the following changes, viz: That in the third and
fourth lines the words "which is the subject of copyright" be struck
out and the word "copyrighted" substituted for them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Section 8.</i>&mdash;In providing the conditions under which a foreign
author or proprietor of any work may obtain copyright on such work
within the United States, section 8 grants certain privileges to a
foreign proprietor which are not granted to an American proprietor of a
foreign work; as, for example, an American proprietor of a foreign
painting who desired to copy and publish it in this country.
</p>

<p>
I would therefore suggest that section 8 after the words "provided,
however" in the fifth line and through subsection (<i>a</i>) read as
follows: "That copyright secured by this act shall extend to the work
of an author who is a citizen or subject of a foreign state or nation
only when such author or the proprietor of the work (<i>a</i>) shall be
living within the United States at the time of the making and first
publication of the work or shall contemporaneously with publication in
some foreign country publish the work within the limits of the United
States."

<p>
<span class="sc">My Dear Mr. Putnam</span>: I beg to acknowledge, with thanks,
various circulars and documents relating to the new copyright bill,
including the proof copy of the bill as printed May 19, and the
printed copy of the bill as introduced May 31, with notices of the
first hearing before the joint committees of the Senate and House,
on Wednesday, June 6, at the Library building, and of the
preliminary conference to be held to-day, all of which have had my
careful attention.
</p>

<p>
I congratulate you that the bill has taken this definite form and
is now to be given a preliminary hearing so that it will be in
shape to be urged for passage next winter. The bill is a monument
to the industry and broad intelligence and information of those who
have been actively concerned in drafting it, and particularly of
yourself and Mr. Solberg. I am proud to have had any share, however
slight, in outlining it, and shall be glad to take part as actively
as possible in urging it upon Congress and commending it to the
people at large.
</p>

<p>
As affecting the interest of my client, the Consolidated Lithograph
Company, which is a large producer of lithographic and other
prints, engravings, etc., especially for use as posters, the form
of the bill seems satisfactory to me and I have no doubt it will be
so to my client. This refers particularly to the provisions of
sections 4 and 5, defining the subject-matter of copyright and the
form of applications for registration. These provisions are in the
highest degree liberal and enlightened.
</p>

<p>
The Consolidated Lithograph Company has suggested that I attend the
hearing in Washington to-morrow. I should like to do this, at least
for the purpose of showing the interest which we feel in the
measure and to assist in impressing the committees of Congress with
its importance, though I know that after this hearing the bill will
simply lie over for further consideration and for action at the
next session. But it seems impracticable for me to be in Washington
to-morrow, and I think that I can be of more service at a later
time, when I hope that the company will still be disposed to send
me there.

Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Section 30; the third subsection of section 30, at
the bottom of page 24, line 25, including all after the words "United
States"&mdash;in other words, that portion of the bill which prohibits
importation by public institutions of a certain class of books.
</p>

<p>
You are well aware of the fact that existing law allows public
libraries to import two copies of any book without any restriction as
to what the book shall be. There are certain points that will make the
suggested legislation a great hardship to the libraries.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Pardon me just a minute. Can you import two
copies of an unauthorized edition?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Can you do that to-day?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Yes, sir; we can now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. A fraudulent reprint, for instance?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. There is absolutely no restriction, as you
understand it to-day?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. There is no restriction at all, as I understand,
on library importations; but there is in this bill in regard to it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I was asking about existing law.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Yes; I understand that libraries can import any
books that they wish.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I had the contrary opinion, but I may be
mistaken.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You object to that entire part of the bill, do
you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Yes; I object to it principally for this reason:
In importations for large libraries, such as those that I represent&mdash;it
does not apply to small libraries which import only a small number of
books&mdash;a case of books will come in from abroad, books that are not
copyrighted in this country, English books. One book in that case
might, by a mistake, be one which was copyrighted here, printed in
England, and containing no notice of its copyright in the United States
of America. If that fact was discovered it would send all of that box
of books to public store; it would place all the box of books, as I
understand, in danger of being destroyed; and it would place the
librarian who did the importing in danger of having to show the
Secretary of the Treasury, under this law, that he was not guilty of
trying to import that book illicitly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Under what section of this law? Let that go in
the record right here.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Sections 28 and 29, I think.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Section 28 is in regard to the condemnation, on
page 21 of the Senate print. Sections 26 to 29 include the penalties
that I have referred to.
</p>

<p>
Our objection to that is the fact that libraries in these days must
have at their disposal as quickly as possible the printed thought of
foreign countries. If there is any delay in our obtaining the box of
books (and those who have had experience, as I have, for thirteen years
in importing books for libraries in this country, know that there is
often six months delay in getting a box of books through the
custom-house where there is the least question as to any of them) it
would mean, practically, that our reason for buying the books at that
time had disappeared. We want the printed English thought as quickly as
possible.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Do you think that is necessary to the efficiency
of a public library?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I do.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That you should get those books immediately?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I do; yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Now, my other reason is a commercial reason; and in order to state it I
shall have to go somewhat into ancient history.
</p>

<p>
About the year 1901 certain publishers of this country formed an
association called the American Publishers' Association, and, in
conjunction with the American Booksellers' Association, entered into an
agreement to control absolutely the selling price of books in this
country. It was an agreement among the publishers that they would not
furnish books to booksellers who would not agree to sell the books at a
standard price&mdash;in other words, a trust proposition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. We have heard of trusts before. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. The libraries were granted a 10 per cent discount
from the price of the class of books affected by this agreement,
so-called net-price books. We discovered, however, on examination, that
these new prices which were fixed were so much higher that the net
result to us was an advance of 25 per cent in the price of the book,
and we found that the majority of those books were not books written by
American authors, but they were books written by English authors and
copyrighted in this country, and that there was a difference in price
amounting to the 25 per cent tariff on printed books. So that this
question, gentlemen, is a question of trusts and a question of tariff.
</p>

<p>
Now, the librarians have been getting around that by importing English
books, because the same book printed on the other side is sold in the
case of these expensive books at a very much reduced price compared
with the price on this side. If&mdash;I am going back now to my first
position&mdash;if I am prevented, by the difficulties in getting through, by
accident, a copyrighted book, from getting at the noncopyrighted book
so long, then I will be forced to go to Mr. Scribner, who will buy the
books for me abroad at his price, against my interest.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Do I understand you to say that that book
trust is still in operation?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Certainly.
</p>

<p>
Now, I am connected with a library that spends $12,000 a year for books
in a country town. Of this sum $5,000 is spent for English books. I am
a representative of a city government which taxes itself to a certain
extent to educate the people in its community, and I object seriously
to paying $1,000 of that $12,000 to American publishers as a tax. That
is my point.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. What changes in this bill do you suggest?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I should suggest the entire elimination of that
provision.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Of the entire paragraph?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. No; after the words "United States."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That was the suggestion I made some time
ago&mdash;after the words "United States," in line 25.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Yes; precisely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Would that be satisfactory to the people whom you
represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. That would be satisfactory. I think it would be
satisfactory to all librarians.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hinshaw</span>. This would allow you to import, however, but one
book, whereas you have had the privilege of importing two?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. One book, but we are perfectly satisfied with
that. I think any library would be. A ruling of the Treasury Department
has held that a branch library is a library itself, so that in the case
of a large library wanting a book for each of several branches it would
be possible to import more than one.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. With that stricken out, the people you represent
would not object to sections 26, 27, 28, and 29?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. No; it does not affect them.
</p>

<p>
The other point I wish to make is on behalf of another interest. I wish
to speak a word in behalf of an interest which is not represented here
at all&mdash;two interests, in fact. The first is the firms that are in the
business of importing books into this country and are not represented
and have not been asked to be represented; have not been asked to come
to these meetings. There are certain firms that are not in the
publishing business that are in the business of importing books.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I think we ought to say right there, as you say
they have not been asked, that the committee invites everybody.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Yes; I mean up to this time they have not been
asked.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Those who were not represented at the conference,
as well as those who were.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Whether they were asked here or not I do not know.
Of course, this being a public hearing, they had a right to appear. But
the point I want to make is this: That a great many of our libraries
have to import books through these men, because they get a cheaper rate
of importation through them than through some of the firms that are
also publishers of books. This would prevent the importation of some of
these books through those firms. It would practically ruin their
English business, largely ruin it; and on behalf of a library that uses
that method of importation largely, it seems to me that some provision
might be made for other importers than those who are publishers of
books.
</p>

<p>
Those are the only arguments that I wish to present.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. To what section of this bill do you now refer?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I am referring to the subsection of this same
section on page 24&mdash;section 30.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Do you mean subsection E?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. No; the subdivision called "First."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Oh, I see.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I suggest this amendment to the clause reading,
"When imported, not more than one copy at one time, for use and not for
sale, under permission given by the proprietor of the American
copyright."
</p>

<p>
I suggest leaving out the consent of the American copyright proprietor.
That changes existing law only in these particulars: It allows the
importation of only one copy instead of two copies, as the existing law
does; it gives the importer who has established a business here based
on legislation, and who is closely in touch&mdash;the firms that I speak of
serve libraries and learned men mostly with expensive books and have
practically no sale to the ordinary public&mdash;it would give them an
opportunity, and it would give a scholar in this country who wants a
book for a particular purpose for his own use and not for sale an
opportunity to import it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. So that if you strike out "under permission given
by the proprietor of the American copyright" it satisfies them?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. It would satisfy the request of the importers, who
are not publishers.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Do you appear for the importers?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I appear for one of them only.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do you feel that you are authorized to speak for
the others?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I am authorized to speak for one firm only.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do you feel that you represent the other
importing firms?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I do not; no. I am quite convinced that I would be
allowed to represent them, but I have had no communication with them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. But you think you state their views on the
subject?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. I have not any doubt of it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You spoke of "ancient history" back as far as
1901. Do you regard anything back behind that as ancient history?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cutter</span>. No; but it is ancient history in the book
business. That is when the publishers of this country discovered that
the Carnegie gifts had made the library trade so large that they must
do something to make some more money out of it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I would
suggest that Mr. Bethune, representing certain of the reproducing
interests particularly&mdash;I ought not to limit that by the word
"reproducing," but who represented at the conference the Reproductive
Arts Copyright League&mdash;should be heard.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF FANEUIL D. S. BETHUNE, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. There are but two or three sections which the
Reproductive Arts Copyright League wish at this time to comment upon.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Millet, on behalf of the artists, has stated that they are
satisfied with the sections relating to paintings as they stand, but as
I understand it the word "accessible," in section 14&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Whereabouts?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. It is the last line on page 10 of the bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I see.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. It is in the second paragraph in the Library
print.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. That is such an indefinite, uncertain term that
we think&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Latimer</span>. What are you referring to; what term?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. The word "accessible"&mdash;"or if a work specified in
subsections F to L, inclusive, of section 5 of this act, upon some
accessible portion of the work itself or of the margin," etc.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Where would you put it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Let it be on some accessible portion, but let the
bill provide that it shall be always uncovered. As it stands now, it
might be on the back of the painting, and the painting might be in a
box, and it would be accessible in a sense.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You would put in the word "uncovered?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. It should be uncovered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Accessible and uncovered?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Accessible and uncovered. We want to be able to
ascertain at once by examining the painting in the frame, if it is in a
frame, whether the picture is copyrighted or not.
</p>

<p>
Section 9 provides, about the fifth or sixth line, that "in the case of
a work of art" the notice "shall be affixed to the original before
publication thereof." The word "publication" is not defined, and it has
been the source of considerable litigation as to what is and is not
publication.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Has that been settled by the courts?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. It has not been settled by the courts. There are
differing decisions now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Is it not ordinarily understood to be the putting
on sale of the object?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No; I think not&mdash;not if it is a private sale. I
think a sale should be specifically stated by the statute to be a
publication, whether a private or a public sale, and the public
exhibition of a painting should be a publication of it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Will you suggest an amendment that will meet your
idea?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I am not prepared to suggest an amendment, but I
shall do so in writing to this committee, if I may.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. In a general way, what is your idea?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. That the statute should state that certain things
shall constitute publication of a work of art, and state that
publication shall include a sale, whether a public or private sale, and
a public exhibition of the work of art.
</p>

<p>
I must refer again to section 14. That provides that not only in
respect of paintings, but also maps and photographs, the notice can be
on the back or the margin. Now, so far as a painting is concerned, that
is quite satisfactory to us if the notice is to be "uncovered," but in
respect of a photograph, which may be very loosely attached to a little
piece of pasteboard, and the notice may be put on the pasteboard, which
could be very easily removed from the photograph. The reproducer to
whom the photograph is then brought, there being no evidence of its
having been detached from any mount, may be easily misled, and before
he discovers that he is infringing he may have invested thousands of
dollars in the undertaking to reproduce it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Then your suggested amendment, "uncovered," does
not meet this objection, which you now state, at all?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. It does in respect of the painting, but I do not
think that so far as the photograph is concerned the law should permit
the notice of copyright to be simply on the thing to which it is
attached or mounted. It should be on the photograph itself. I think
that that will prevent litigation and expense to both photographers and
reproducers.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I ask Mr. Bethune to state
whether, under the present law, the notice can be put on the mount of a
photograph? Is that your understanding&mdash;that it can not be, and that
this is an extension of the privilege?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I understand that it can under the present law.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. That it can now; so that this simply repeats the
privilege.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. An objection was made here yesterday, I think, on
the ground that it would deface the photograph.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes; that objection has been made by the
photographers; but I leave it to the intelligence of this committee&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. And in case of a fine picture, for instance, the
artist might object to having the words prescribed by this act
appearing permanently upon the face of the picture.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes, he might; but as a matter of fact, I am
informed that there are very, very few artists who do not insist upon
putting some mark, if not their name, upon the face of their painting.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Can you call attention to that section?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. There is no section in this bill providing for
the placing of the notice upon the face of the painting; but, I say,
there are very few artists, I am informed&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Where is the section that prescribes the form?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Section 14.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. On page 10.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. It may be simply a "C," with a little circle
around it.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Do you object to the word "accessible" here,
on line 10?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes; the word "accessible."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Except as coupled with the word "uncovered."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. If this language were made to read "accessible
and uncovered," it would necessarily, then, require that it be placed
upon the face of the photograph or picture, would it not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No; I think not.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. You could not put it on the back, where it would
be uncovered?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No; I do not think that that would be covered&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. How about the word "visible?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. "Visible" was the word which I suggested at the
conference. I do not know why it was not put in.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I may say, Mr. Bethune, if you will permit me, Mr.
Chairman, that this question of notice was a long-discussed question
between the artist group and the committee of the reproduction group;
and they started, of course, at very opposite extremes. We understood
finally that they reached this point: That in the first place there
should be a notice. That was a concession on the part of the artist
group, who thought there ought not to be any notice except their own
name. That there should be a notice&mdash;that is, something to indicate
copyright, even if it should be only "C" within a circle&mdash;was insisted
upon by the reproducing group. So that it was agreed that there should
be something to indicate copyright. Where should it be?
</p>

<p>
Now, the present statute uses the term "visible;" but the reproducing
group said (if I am wrong, Mr. Bethune will correct me): "We do not
care that it shall be visible in the sense that he who runs may read
it. We do not care, even, that it shall necessarily be on the front of
the painting. It may be on the back of the painting. It must not be on
the frame, because the frame is a detachable thing. People's tastes as
to frames differ, and one collector likes one, while his successor may
prefer another, and he will change the frame, and with it goes the
notice. It must be on the thing itself"&mdash;that was their
contention&mdash;"but it may be on the back."
</p>

<p>
Now, if it is on the back, is the word "visible" descriptive? We wanted
to get some word that would indicate that it might be put in some place
where it could be found by somebody looking for it, and that was the
requirement of the reproducer that somebody with a sincere desire, not
with a malicious intention to appropriate it, but with a sincere desire
to find out whether it was copyrighted or not, might find out with a
reasonable search intending to look for it. That was satisfactory to
them and that was the endeavor in using the word "accessible."
</p>

<p>
Now, it is that little doubt which Mr. Bethune has suggested to you.
Would it cover the back? And would it cover and prevent a case of
covering it up? The notice might be covered up. So he has suggested the
addition of the words "and uncovered," but the use of the word
"accessible" rather than the word "visible" was to endeavor to express
what we understood to be agreed to, as the agreed intention.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I think it will express it if "uncovered" is
added.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I should add that the reproducers definitely
objected to the privilege on the part of the photographers, and so on,
the print publishers, etc., of putting the notice on the mount; but of
course it was understood that they had that privilege at present. They
have that privilege at present, but the reproducers never thought that
that was reasonable, and did not concede it to be reasonable.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Now, reproducers are open to fraudulent attempts
to sell to them copyrighted works by simply removing the notice of
copyright, and section 25, in the draft of the bill, imposes simply a
penalty of $100 as a minimum and $1,000 as a maximum fine for the
removal of this notice. We think that the punishment should be
imprisonment as well as fine. We want to protect ourselves from that
fraud, which is very frequently encountered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. So that that paragraph of that section as it
stands is satisfactory to you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Section 25, sir?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No. We want, as well as a punishment by fine of
not less than $100, the words inserted "or imprisonment" or "and
imprisonment," both for a specified term; it is not material how long
it shall be.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Have you suggested your amendment to this section 14
that some word instead of "accessible" should be used? Did you suggest
"visible"? Was that your idea?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. That was the word which we did suggest, but
"accessible" is satisfactory to us if "uncovered" is coupled with it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You want it to read "accessible and uncovered"?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Would that apply to a magazine picture&mdash;a picture in
a magazine that had the notice on the back of the original? You could
look for it, and it would be uncovered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. In the case of a magazine, as I understand, it
would be covered by the copyright of the magazine.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Well, that is all right; I did not understand how
that would be.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Those are the principal features&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. I would like to ask you with reference to
that suggestion which you were referring to in regard to publication in
the matter of a work of art, or a plastic work or drawing. Is there any
definite suggestion that you could make, any definite change, so as to
convey your idea? I think I know what you want; but it seems to me it
is going to be pretty difficult to use an expression there that will
convey the exact idea that you desire. Now, in the matter of a work of
art, as long as it remains in the hands of the creator of it, one would
think it would not be necessary, but it was suggested to me by the
chairman here that even the maker of the work of art might want to
copyright it, although he did not intend to sell it; he would want to
prevent people from infringing on it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Precisely.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. And yet there would be no publication; he
could keep it in his own library.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. He has the right to copyright it at any time he
pleases, before publication.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. I know that; but the point is, What does the
word "publication" here mean? And I would like to know, if you have
given the thing any thought, if there is any suggestion you could make?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes, sir; I think the term "publication" should
be explained. I do not think we can define altogether what
"publication" is; but we can state that certain things shall be
included within "publication."
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. What is your suggestion?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I think that sale, whether a public or private
sale of the painting, and the public exhibition of the painting, should
be construed as a publication.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You suggest inserting after "original" "before
publication, exhibition, or offering for sale?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No, sir; I should let "publication" stand there,
but I should qualify or partially define in another section what
"publication" is&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Is there not danger in making such definition?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No; I think not, if you state what it shall
include, or rather what shall be included in it.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Suppose we define publication in the manner you
suggest, would there not be difficulty in cases not covered by that
definition?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I think not, sir.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Might not the courts construe that definition as
covering all classes of publications?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Not if the statute specifically states that those
expressions are not meant to be an exact definition of all that
publication includes, and I think that can be very easily done.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We would be very glad to have your suggestion on
that point.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I should be very glad to submit it if you will be
kind enough to permit me to do so.
</p>

<p>
There are some other matters which I do not care to take up your time
with now, and will do so in writing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Is your idea of expressing and defining
"publication" for the purpose of limiting the word "publication?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Not altogether; no, sir. I think that both the
reproducer and the artist should know the exact situation at the very
outset. If the artist exhibits a painting in a gallery and people pay
fifty cents or nothing to go in and look at the painting, although
there is a restriction, perhaps, made by the artist upon copying that
painting, when the painting goes to that exhibition he should know at
once, and the reproducer should know, that that being a public
exhibition is a publication of the painting, and if the copyright
notice is not on it then the artist has lost entirely the right to
copyright it entirely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You are aware of the fact that if you undertake
to define "publication" you do limit it to whatever you say it is?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I do if I attempt to fully define it, but I
should not attempt to so define it. I should attempt to say that
certain things should be embraced in the term "publication."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Do you not thereby exclude everything else?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. If Mr. Bethune will permit me, Mr. Chairman, the
attention of the committee may not have been called to the fact that
there is a definition of the date of publication where copies are
reproduced for sale or distribution. That is in section 63. It is
limited to that because, after discussion, the conference did not seem
to be able, or none of our advisers seemed to be able, to suggest a
definition for "publication" in the case of works of art, for instance,
of which copies are not reproduced. It seemed to those who were
advising us a dangerous thing to attempt.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I think it would be, and I would not undertake
it, but I think you will save trouble and expense to both the artists
and the reproducers if you will say that the sale, whether private or
public, and the public exhibition, shall be a publication of the
painting.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. That is what I asked you a while ago&mdash;if you did not
think, speaking of "publication" here, that it would be sufficient if
you were to let it read "public exhibition or offering the same for
sale," either public or private sale?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. To be included in the term "publication."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. But can you think of any other instance where
publication would mean something else than those things?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No; I can not for the moment, but I think there
is danger, as the chairman has just stated&mdash;there may be many things
which do not occur to me now, or would not occur to this committee,
which should be contained in a definition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. I think you would complicate it very much if you
used the word "publication" generally, and then undertook to define
"publication" also, and intended that "publication" should cover more
points than you specified.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Why, sir, this bill starts in and says that all
the works of an author may be copyrighted. It then specifies some of
the things, and it then says that the things specified are not all that
may be included.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. I understand that; but you, a man who is expert in
these matters, can not state to us what other points would be covered
than public exhibition or offering the same for sale.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. I am not a reproducer; I am a lawyer, and the
reproducers may be able to advise me.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. A lawyer is an originator always. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You spoke earlier in your remarks about the
decisions of courts on this subject.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. And the lack of uniformity of the decisions
relative to publication. Is not that fact due to the conditions which
you now describe, and which have been suggested by different members of
the committee&mdash;because what may be publication in one copyrightable
article may not be publication in another?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes, sir. For that reason&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Now, then, if the courts, with this attempt to
define publication, have found difficulty and have differed, is it not
because of the different character of the articles that have been
involved in the litigation before the courts?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No; it is the same article that I have in mind.
There is one Massachusetts case, a Federal case, where, in the case of
a public exhibition of a painting, the circuit court of appeals in the
first district held that that was a publication of the painting.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Was the exhibition given for hire, for profit?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes; my recollection is that it was a public
exhibition for hire. Subsequently another case&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. It held that that constituted publication?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. That that constituted publication.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. It did not define what publication was any
more than that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. No; it simply decided that that particular public
exhibition was a publication of the work.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. In other words, it decided that in that case
special acts constituted a publication?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Yes, sir. Now, the Federal courts in New York
State have held the contrary view in respect of a public exhibition of
a painting for hire (in the Workmeister cases). Those cases will
probably go up to the Supreme Court, but they may not.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. What was the argument or the reasoning of the
court in the latter decision?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. The Massachusetts case was distinguished, if my
memory is correct, on the fine point that in one case there was a
reservation&mdash;in the one case the artist made some reservation in
respect of the use of the painting when he loaned it to the exhibition,
and in the other case he did not; but it is just those fine points
which we want to eliminate.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. From what you say, I think it would be well
for us to avoid the word "publication" and state just what we want
without using the word "publication" at all, if we are going to give
rise to diverse decisions and litigation. I think we had better express
it, perhaps, in the language which you have&mdash;"after sale or exhibition
for hire" and "public exhibition."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. Well, there you do limit it.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Just express it in those words.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bethune</span>. There you do limit distinctly what would be, in
effect, publication, though you do not call it so, and that we do not
want.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We would be very glad if you would submit your
proposed amendment to the committee later.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman, I understand that Mr. W. A.
Livingstone, representing certain reproducing interests, and Mr.
McDonald, representing the National Photographers' Copyright League,
wish to have a note recorded&mdash;not to argue a point, but simply to have
a note recorded in the minutes.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF WILLIAM A. LIVINGSTONE, ESQ., OF DETROIT, MICH.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. Mr. Chairman, I simply wish to state two
things in contradiction of the last speaker. I stand here for a large
reproductive interest, and consequently we are speaking also from the
standpoint of the reproducer. We dissent very strongly from his opinion
and we support the bill in respect to notice as it now is.
</p>

<p>
That is all we wish to say now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You want the word "accessible" kept in just as it is
now?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. What do you understand that to mean?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. I understand that to imply that that notice
must be easily get-at-able in the painting or other object.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Well, "accessible" means "get-at-able."
</p>

<p>
Mr.<span class="sc"> Livingstone</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. But you have not got "easily accessible" in here.
You have got "accessible," simply, whether with difficulty or whether
with ease.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. In the case of a painting or work of art it
is very easy&mdash;you can hardly conceive of a case where, if the notice is
accessible at all, it can not be obtained.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Well, why should you object to the word
"uncovered"&mdash;"accessible and uncovered?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. Because if you include the word "uncovered"
you then impose some other conditions which are the result of that
term, as, for example, you may compel the notice to be on the face. I
will give a concrete illustration that is easily understood. Suppose
you have a very small miniature which is very delicately painted. You
can not put that notice across the face of the miniature, and yet you
can take the miniature in your hands and turn it over and find the
notice in an accessible place with ease.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Do you think, though, that "accessible and
uncovered" means putting it on the front of the painting or photograph?
Could it not be on the back and be still uncovered on the back?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. The painting may be hanging on the wall.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. It would still be uncovered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. Oh, not necessarily; no, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. As far as the painting itself is concerned, I do not
know why you all quibble between "accessible" and "uncovered," and I
did not know what was the real difficulty between you on this word
"accessible." The word "visible" has been suggested.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Livingstone</span>. Another case would be this: In certain kinds
of sculptures you could not possibly put that notice upon the face of
the sculpture without a serious marring of it, without a serious
impairment of its commercial value. The law even now takes cognizance
of this, and permits you, in those cases, to put it on the bottom or on
the back. It may not necessarily be uncovered, but it is accessible.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF PIRIE MACDONALD, ESQ., OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS' COPYRIGHT
LEAGUE.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pirie MacDonald</span>. We wish to stand for the word "accessible"
as it has been evolved by the Librarian, and we would wish that in
case the word "uncovered" is used it be very strictly defined; that
it be defined as to when this picture should be uncovered. If, for
example&mdash;and remember, please, that I am speaking merely for
photographers, and not as a reproductionist&mdash;suppose I were to make a
photograph of someone, and were to properly and duly mark it with the
notice as prescribed by law (for example, a photograph of yourself),
and you were to decide that you objected to the notice as being a
defacement, and you were to take it on yourself not to take the notice
from the picture (because that would be prevented by the proposed law)
but to cover it up. It is your property, unquestionably; and it gets
to the hand of a reproducer and he says, "This is not uncovered."
Therefore I suggest that in case by any chance the word "uncovered" is
used, it be very strictly defined.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman, there are a great many people here
who are interested in behalf of the provisions in the bill proposing
protection against the mechanical devices for the reproduction of music
to the ear. There are many here who are opposed to the provisions of
the bill, and those who are its proponents are in favor of them. They
are, of course, very desirous to near the arguments advanced by those
who are against them, and, if it be your pleasure, I would suggest that
it would be only fair to hear from the opponents of those provisions as
soon as possible. I have called as many as I knew of the participants
in the conference who cared to say anything at this stage in favor of
the bill. One additional participant to those who have spoken,
representing the directory publishers&mdash;I think that association is not
here&mdash;states, in a letter:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
I take this opportunity to say that our association fully indorses
the bill as presented to Congress, with the single exception of the
final paragraph of section 13.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That is the paragraph requiring that in the affidavit as to manufacture
the place in which the work was done and the establishment shall be
specified. I simply ask that that go into the record as coming from the
American Directory Publishers.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. What reason is given for that request?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I understand the reason to be that it would be an
undue burden upon the publishers.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. In what respect?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I think perhaps the publishers ought to answer
that. It is a specification on which they alleged to the conferences
might be inconvenient and difficult in some cases. In the case of
directories, the directory publishers said that they were in the habit
of having their work done at a great many establishments. Of our
general legal advisers, as you have asked me, I feel that I ought to
state this: The chairman of the advisory committee of the American Bar
Association is not here to state it himself, as he stated it to us: but
he was of the opinion that it was not relevant to the affidavit. But I
do not see that at this point, sir, this question can be discussed,
because the persons who are opposed to this provision are not fully
represented here.
</p>

<p>
Of those on the list of participants that cared to be heard at this
point I know of no others, except that Mr. Sullivan, who represents the
International Typographical Union, not caring to make any argument or
statement, but possibly caring to do so later, if he may, would like to
say just a word in behalf of the general principles of the bill, or on
behalf of the bill as a whole&mdash;the feeling of the Typographical Union
as to the bill.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF J. J. SULLIVAN, ESQ., REPRESENTING THE INTERNATIONAL
TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. Senators and Representatives, I do not desire to
take up any of your time just at this hour, as there are many gentlemen
here from out of town who wish to be heard before the committee. I
therefore desire to be heard at some future time, as I understand you
will have a session of this committee to-morrow; and on behalf of the
organization, the International Typographical Union, which I have the
honor to represent, I particularly protest against any modification of
section 13, known as the manufacturing clause of the copyright law.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Is that in this bill or the present law?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. This bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. I refer to section 13, known as the
manufacturing clause of the old act and copied in the new one. Speaking
also on behalf of my associates from New York, representing 7,500
typographers, we protest against any modification of this law.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. You must make it clear whether you refer to this
bill or to the existing law. Are you satisfied with the bill?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. I refer to the revised bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. You are satisfied with the bill as it stands?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. The Senate bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You are referring simply to section 13?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. Section 13; yes. That is, the old section.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do you approve in all respects the bill as
introduced in the Senate and House?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. No, Senator; I respectfully beg to differ in
this respect&mdash;that either through inadvertence or slight mistake in the
draft of the bill that has been submitted to the Representatives taking
part in these conferences there are six lines bracketed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. They are not bracketed in the official bill. They
were left out of the bill as introduced.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. I respectfully request that section 13 of the
bill as presented to the Representatives taking part in the conferences
here be revised in the Senate bill so as to include the paragraph that
is bracketed in the draft of the bill sent out to the delegates.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Well, Mr. Sullivan, I want you to be clear about
this. The bill as introduced into Congress did not contain those
brackets. That was a draft sent out some time ago, and the bill as
introduced in Congress has not those brackets.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. (after examining the official copy of the bill).
That is on page 9; that is all right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It is right as it is, as we understand?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. It is right as it is. That is all right, then;
we have no objection, Senator, to the bill as it stands. I only wish to
say at this time that that bill has already passed the lower branch of
Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You refer to section 13?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>. Yes, sir; and Representative Currier knows it
has also passed his committee. We respectfully submit the resolution to
your hands, and I desire to be heard on it to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman, with your permission Mr. G. Howlett
Davis, of New York, desires to be heard as representing inventors who
have allied themselves particularly to these devices for the
reproduction of music to the ear. Mr. Davis's suggestion was that as
the composers had been heard as the creators of the music in the first
instance, one who is engaged as an inventor in the production of these
devices should first be heard on the other side.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">S. T. Cameron</span>. May it please the committee, Mr. Chairman,
I am one of those who are representing the interests of the talking
machines of the country.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Whom do you represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I represent the American Graphophone Company of
New York.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do you desire to be heard by the committee?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Yes, sir. I wish to say at this point, however,
sir, that with all due respect to the Librarian, it would seem to me
that there is no good reason existing why he should depart from the
mode of procedure in connection with these talking machines that has
been taken in all the rest of the bill&mdash;that is, that those who are the
proponents for the changes in this bill that are of a very radical
nature and very radically different from existing law should present to
the committee their reasons for such changes, before hearing from the
opponents of the bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I had no intention, Mr. Chairman, of departing
from that mode of procedure. I understood that two gentlemen in behalf
of these provisions had been heard, Mr. Sousa and Mr. Herbert; and I
had also been informed that the other interests, including those of the
publishers, did not care to be heard at this point; they were content
to have the provision before you as the affirmative. I desire now that
the opponents of the bill should have the fullest opportunity, at the
earliest possible moment, to present their views to the committee. The
opponents have not advised me as to whether they had agreed upon any
method of presenting their case. I simply had this suggestion from Mr.
Davis which I laid before you, and the fact that Mr. O'Connell,
representing ten manufacturers of automatic piano players, also wishes
to be heard.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Paul H. Cromelin</span>. Mr. Chairman, as the representative of
the Columbia Phonograph Company, I should like to know whether it is
the purpose of this committee to sit to-morrow. I had promised certain
gentlemen in New York City to telephone them between half after 12
to-day and 1 o'clock, so that they can leave on the Congressional
Limited and be here to-morrow, if it is your intention to-morrow to
hear the opponents of this bill.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span> (after consultation with other members of the
committee). We will meet to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. And may I ask also, Mr. Chairman, if it is your
intention to continue these proceedings this afternoon?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We will continue this session until about half
past 1.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Albert H. Walker</span>. Mr. Chairman, I wish to inquire whether
the committee is willing to sit also on Saturday to continue the
hearings?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span> (after further consultation). It is the purpose
of the committee, if possible, to finish its hearings to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I wish to suggest to the committee that this bill
is incomparably the most important measure that has been before any
Committee on Patents of either House of the American Congress at any
time since the civil war, and I think it is the most important measure
that ever was before any Committee on Patents of the American Congress
since the enactment of the patent law in 1836.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. It is not the purpose of the committee to
deprive anyone who desires a hearing of that privilege. On the
contrary, the committee will sit so long as anyone desires to be heard,
within any sort of reason.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. If the Senator will permit me one moment, I am
prepared and have been preparing myself through a rather long lifetime
to elucidate the subject of copyright law; and I appear before the
committee in the interests of the American people and also in the
interests of the authors.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. How much time do you wish, Mr. Walker?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I wish at least two hours, and I can take it at
any time at the convenience of the committee, at any day.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span> (after further consultation with the other
members of the committee). We will hear you, Mr. Walker, one hour
to-morrow morning, if we are unable to reach you to-day, with the
privilege of submitting in writing your views if you so desire.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. If the chairman will allow me to make the
suggestion, if I were to be heard to-morrow for an hour, that would
probably cut off other gentlemen who would wish to speak much shorter
than that, and it would be very convenient for me, if the committee is
to sit at all on Saturday, to hear other gentlemen on Friday and let me
speak on Saturday.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. If we are compelled to hold a session on
Saturday, we will hear you on that day; but we hope that the gentlemen
who are present to present their views to the committee will finish in
such time as will permit you to have your hour to-morrow morning.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Then, is it understood that I am to speak first
to-morrow morning?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. I think not.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. There are some other gentlemen here who will want
five or ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Inasmuch as you prefer to go over until
Saturday, if convenient to the committee, I should think that the
members from out of town and the other gentlemen here should be first
to address the committee.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. That is very agreeable to me.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I sincerely trust, Mr. Chairman, that in Mr.
Walker's discussion it will not be permitted to discuss the copyright
of the past. We are not after that. We want a copyright of the future.
If he will talk about things that will be for the benefit of the
future, I think you should give him the time; but if he is going into a
discussion of what was done a hundred or two hundred or three hundred
years ago, we do not want it. [Laughter.] That is the past; we want the
future.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like to give notice, as
the representative of the Columbia Phonograph Company, representing
large interests which are vitally affected by this bill; as the
representative of a company which knew nothing of this proposed
legislation before the publication took place on the 31st of May; as
the representative of a company that was not invited to take part in
the so-called conferences, notwithstanding the fact that its industry
is so broad that it embraces the world, that I would like to be heard,
and that it will probably take at least one hour or two hours to
present this subject in all of its ramifications to your committee. It
was my understanding that the committee would adjourn to-day at 12 or 1
o'clock, and in view of the fact that the opponents of this measure
have had to come together quickly, and that they have had no time to
organize, while on the other hand those who are proposing it have had
conferences for more than one year, I propose, sir, that it would be
meet and proper at this time to adjourn this conference until to-morrow
morning, giving the opponents of the measure a chance to decide upon a
plan of action for presenting this matter to your committee, and that
we will come here to-morrow morning and present the various views of
those who are interested.
</p>

<p>
I therefore suggest the advisability of a postponement until to-morrow
morning or an adjournment.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do I understand that all the opponents of the
provisions of this law relative to talking-machine devices can be heard
within one hour?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. No, sir. I speak on behalf of myself, for my own
industry only. There are others&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. How many desire a hearing?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I believe that there are at least a half a dozen
gentlemen who desire a hearing.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Does each want one hour?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I do not know how long it will take them to
present their views.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We established a rule at the beginning of the
hearings yesterday limiting the statements to ten minutes each.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I understood, Mr. Chairman, that that was in
regard to the proponents of the measure. I did not understand that you
intended to limit those persons whose interests are vitally affected by
this measure to ten minutes to reply. I do not believe that is the
intention of this committee; and I submit the question to the honorable
chairman.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Mr. Chairman, it is entirely out of all reason to
expect us to remember what these gentlemen will say. We will want a
good deal of it in typewriting anyhow; and they can simply give a
synopsis of an argument here as to what they want to do, and we must
expect them to submit to the committee in writing for our use such
matters as they seem to think important for our consideration when we
are giving the bill consideration. They do not need so long a time to
make a speech here. Let them prepare their matter and hand it in.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Mr. Chairman, we hope to file briefs in addition
to the oral statements.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. As far as the House committee is concerned there
is no expectation that there will be a report of this bill at this
session of the Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Will the gentleman be good enough to state that
positively on behalf of the committee, so that the interests that ought
to be represented here to-day, and whose representatives must remain
away, can be satisfied on that point?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I can state it most positively, as far as the
House is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. And the same is true so far as the Senate is
concerned.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I thank you very much. We have endeavored to get
that information from the Librarian, and he stated yesterday that it
was highly improbable, but he could not state&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Cromelin, if you will excuse me, I said that I
had no right to give any such prophecy on the part of the committee; it
was not within my control. You will do me the justice to say, Mr.
Cromelin, that I added that when the copyright office asked for this
bill to be introduced it had no expectation itself of any possibility
of its being reported at this session.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Thank you very much for the information I have
gotten from the Librarian and from the chairmen of the respective
committees. That assures us on the point, for the first time, that this
bill will not be reported at this session of Congress.
</p>

<p>
(After a consultation between the members of the committees:)
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. The committee has decided that it will hear some
representative of all these interests, if they shall so desire, not
exceeding an hour, with the same permission to supply in writing such
matter as they may desire, as was given to Mr. Walker. I might add that
it seems to us that the representatives of these interests can state
concisely in that time their objections to the bill as introduced in
the Senate and House, leaving the details to be supplied in writing, as
I have suggested. It does not seem necessary to us, unless it is
desired by these representatives, to have each gentleman representing
each manufactory make a speech to this committee. We think that it will
be giving you all a fair opportunity to be heard to comply with the
suggestion that has been made.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. The interests are about the same.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. The interests are precisely the same, as I
understand it, so that the objections must be along the same line.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I merely state that as regards
sound records as understood by a phonograph record, a graphophone
record, or a telegraphonic record, the interests may not be the same.
We are standing together against the whole measure; but it must be
fully understood that in so far as relates to the reproduction of
sounds previously produced, there may be a distinction between a
sound-producing machine and a sound-reproducing machine.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We think that those distinctions can be very
well brought out in your written communications to the committee.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">John J. O'Connell</span>. Mr. Chairman, perhaps if the suggestion
of Mr. Cromelin were complied with&mdash;that is, that a recess be taken
until to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock&mdash;the various interests covering
the music rolls and the phonographic records could get together and
decide how to present their views to this committee, and in that way
save time; and afterwards each could enlarge in his written brief on
the points which he wishes to make.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That is so as to that particular thing, but if
there is someone who wishes to be heard on some other point, why not
hear him now?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We will postpone this question until to-morrow
morning, and we will hope to finish that branch of the case, as well as
the argument of Mr. Walker, to-morrow morning from 10 until 12.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. As I stated to the chairman, the only thing in
which my clients are interested is the music rolls, and that is the
only question I personally wish to present to this committee. Perhaps
the same question may be embraced in the points to be raised by the
phonographic record people as well.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. And I will say to you and the other gentlemen
who are interested that you can divide that hour between yourselves as
you may please, or you can select some representative to take the
entire hour.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Mr. Remich, of New Hampshire, is here, and wishes
to be heard briefly on another section of the bill.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF DANIEL O. REMICH, ESQ., OF LITTLETON, N.H.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Mr. Chairman, I appear here to-day in behalf of
the stereoscopic view manufacturers of the country. There are at least
twelve large manufacturers of this description of views. There may be
some that are not familiar with that class of view; it is the double
view that you look at through the stereoscope. The firm to which I
belong is the founder of this business, D. W. Kilburn &amp; Co., of
Littleton, N.H., in the White Mountains. There are, as I say, now
twelve large concerns, which are competitors. I appear here in behalf
of the stereoscopic view manufacturers, who approve of this bill,
except one provision, and that is the provision as to the copyright
fee.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. What section is that, Mr. Remich?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. That is section 60. You will notice that under the
old law the fee for copyrighting was 50 cents. The fee is now made a
dollar, which advances that expense upon our industry 100 per cent.
</p>

<p>
Inasmuch as the report of the office shows that there is a good
handsome surplus of cash received, more than enough to pay for all the
expense of maintaining the Copyright Office, and in addition to that
some 213,000 objects, which the Librarian says are of great value to
the Nation&mdash;books, paintings, etc.&mdash;and in view of the small profit in
the manufacture of our goods, and the fact that in the conduct of our
business we have to make long-term contracts with general agents who
handle our goods, selling them over the entire world, and that our
contracts have been made for a long term of years, this 100 per cent
advance upon our class of goods would practically put us out of
business.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Suppose we except those views?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. I have no objection to that. You will see that
they have tried to modify this provision somewhat by a section at the
bottom of the twenty-fifth page of the conference report, in which they
say&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. The thirty-eighth page of the bill, gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. The thirty-eighth page of the bill, in which they
say:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>Provided further</i>, That only one registration at one fee
shall be required in the case of several volumes of the same book
or periodical deposited at the same time, or of a numbered series
of any work specified in subsections H, J, K, and L of section 5 of
this act&mdash;
</p>
</div>

<p>
Which includes our class of products&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
where such series represents the same subject with variances only
in pose or composition, and the items composing it are deposited at
the same time under one title with a view to a single registration.
</p>
</div>

<p>
As a lawyer, I suggest that would inject a dangerous element into our
business, if we tried to copyright a series of pictures which we
claimed only differed from each other in pose, and we should have more
litigation on our hands in a month than you could shake a stick at. It
would ruin any stereoscopic view concern in a little while.
</p>

<p>
As I suggested in our conference, that clause would apply
satisfactorily to gallery work where a man, for instance, took my
distinguished friend, the Representative from my district, Mr. Currier,
in a gallery, and took a side view, a front view, a view standing up, a
view sitting down, a view with his chin turned up, and a view with his
nose turned out. In such a case there would be no change save in pose.
But we send artists all over the world. We had an artist in the
Japanese army during this war, and with the Russian army, and in the
South African war, and in Cuba, and in the Boxer war. Our negatives are
largely snapshots of moving objects and things. We may get one
distinguished general in one snapshot, the next negative we make will
show another distinguished general.
</p>

<p>
If we go to a great parade to make negatives, as we did at the Czar's
coronation in Russia, we are liable to get more than 500 different
negatives, and they all differ in something besides pose and
composition. You will see that a clause of that kind will make it
absolutely impossible for us to take advantage of it, although any
gallery artist could take advantage of it with success and safety.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Have you the form of an amendment which you
propose?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. No. I have not framed any amendment. An exemption
of the stereoscopic manufacturers from the $1 fee would be perfectly
satisfactory to us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Not the exclusion of the entire fee? You do not
mean that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Not at all; we are perfectly willing to pay our
50-cent fee, although it amounts to a tremendous sum in our business,
because we take so many negatives. To show the extent of our business,
permit me to say that we have over 17,000 different subjects in stock
ready for delivery. We have over 160,000 different negatives at the
present time, and are importing them constantly and making them in this
country.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. The reason I asked the question was because the
language here indicates that the exception you propose should be
inserted with much care.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. And I will be glad if you will draw your
proposed amendment and insert it in the record.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. It seems to me it is going to be a difficult thing
to make an exception. What is the necessity of an advance in the fee?
Why is there any necessity for a change of the fee when in England, as
I understand it, they charge only a shilling for doing this work, which
is one-half of what we pay, and when, in point of fact, we are getting
a handsome surplus&mdash;as the report of the copyright office shows, over
$130,000 profit in the last six years? The office is not intended as a
revenue producer. It is simply designed to protect the manufacturing
interests of the country by copyright.
</p>

<p>
Of course to the man who is producing a painting or a valuable book
which he may sell and obtain in royalties $50,000 on, it does not make
any difference. Some men have told me they do not care; they wish the
copyright fee could be $75, because larger fees for copyrighting would
tend to keep out a lot of fellows. But we have a great big industry
which is employing a large number of people which would be ruined by
these additional charges.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Your suggestion, then, is to reduce the fee
prescribed in section 60 from $1 to 50 cents?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Yes; leave it exactly as it is now; yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Were you present at the hearing yesterday?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. I was not present; no.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Mr. Putnam commented upon the situation, stating
that the fee under existing law was 50 cents, and the fee for
certification was 50 cents, and the only difference between the
existing law and this bill upon that subject is that in all cases a
certificate is to be issued, making the entire fee $1.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. You can see the effect of that. In my experience
in connection with the view business, for twenty years, we have had
occasion to get but five certificates. Think of that. We have paid
$2.50 in the whole time, whereas under this bill we shall be compelled
to take a certificate at an expense of half a dollar with every
negative that we copyright, whether we want it or not.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. How many times have you gotten certificates now?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. I say, that in all my experience with the view
business&mdash;and I have been connected with it ever since I married Mr.
Kilbourn's daughter and went into the firm in 1890, sixteen years
ago&mdash;we have had only five certificates.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. What is the object of your having those
certificates?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. We took them simply because we had a few views
pirated, and in the litigation we wanted to show the fact that they
were legally copyrighted by a certificate from the office. But this law
is going to compel us to take out thousands of certificates that will
be of no earthly use to us. This extra expense will practically drive
us out of business. This is no "pipe dream," but an absolute fact.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. You do not object to the 50 cents for the fee
and 50 cents more for the certificate?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Not at all; only we do not want to be compelled to
pay half a dollar each for thousands and thousands of certificates that
are of no earthly use to us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I take it that the purpose of this law is to
provide a notice in some form or other for everything, and this is in
that nature.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. No; this is not in the nature of a notice. This
certificate gives no notice to the public.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. They would have to come here and dig out the
records if they wanted to find out about that. The only argument that I
have heard in favor of this suggestion is that it will diminish the
amount of work that will have to be done in the copyright office. If
they can make one certificate cover twenty views or twenty-five views
or a hundred views, they will not have to make so many certificates. Is
there any good reason why my business should be ruined to accomplish
such a result when there are plenty of people that want to work in the
office and when the present revenues are amply sufficient to pay for
all the work done? In my town we are exempting property from taxation
and offering big financial inducements to bring manufacturing interests
into our town, because they are going to employ more labor. I do not
suppose Washington has reached the point where it has so much
population that it does not want more men and women employed in
Washington, performing honest day labor and earning good money to be
expended in the city.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. What is the reason assigned for uniting these
two fees in one; do you know?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. I was not here, and I did not hear the reasons.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. I was not here, either, so I do not know.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. For the benefit of the Senator I might explain
that the idea was this, Senator: That the office will hereafter furnish
the certificate in all cases as a matter of course, which heretofore
has been furnished only when requested; and that in furnishing it it
should charge for it as heretofore, making the charge therefor $1.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. Still, the certificate is not necessary
except where it is desired to prove the fact that the copyright has
been secured.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. It was with the idea that it was a precaution that
the copyright proprietor ought in reason to take.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. I have no doubt that there are many persons
situated as this gentleman is who do not want any certificate except in
very rare cases.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. That is right.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. To what extent do you now issue certificates?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Register, to what extent is that done?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. For last year the total of registrations numbered
116,000, and of those 28,087 were certificates.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. That is about one-fifth.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. It should be remembered that requests for
certificates additional to the certificate paid for at the time of
registration are constant, and in addition to fees submitted to secure
certificates, constant inquiry is made of the Copyright Office and
answered at some service cost as to what entries have been made by
particular firms. They ask us "just what entries did we make in May
last?"
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. What were the gross receipts of the Copyright
Office for the last fiscal year?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. The receipts&mdash;this is for the calendar year,
Senator, those being the latest figures which I have.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Very well.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. The fees for the total calendar year were
$78,518, of which the certificate fees were $14,043.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. What are the expenses of the office?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. The total expenses of the office can not be
given. The comparison given here is between the appropriations for
service only, and I could give you that for the year.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. That is for the fiscal year. In this case we have
had to take the last fiscal year, with your permission.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. The fees for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1905, were $78,058. The appropriations for service during the same
period were $74,662.46&mdash;the appropriation expended for service, but the
only element covered is service cost. It does not cover printing,
stationery, or any supplies, nor the printing of the catalogue of
entries, which include all registrations made at any fee, even if no
certificate is paid for. That is estimated at $25,000 per year&mdash;the
printer's estimate for printing. If that is included with all other
expenses, the fees do not cover the total expenses of running the
office.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. By how much?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. I have not been able to ascertain the exact
figures for printing, but I should suppose that the balance might be
some thousands of dollars against the office.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You have some figures, Mr. Remich; you made some
statement earlier in your remarks upon that subject.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Yes, sir. I took this leaf from the report, and I
will read it. This is the last year's report of the office:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The earned fees paid into the Treasury for the year ($78,518)
exceeded the amount expended for salaries, which was $74,600.37.
The additional expenditures during the year for stationery and
other supplies can not at this date be obtained from the chief
clerk of the Library, but for the first six months of the year they
amounted to but $309.63, and the year's contingent expenditures,
therefore, should be under $1,000. The yearly average for the last
five years has been $954.29.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Then they say:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The appropriations for 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, and the first
half of the fiscal year 1906 include the sum of $25,740, to be used
in bringing up the arrears of work prior to July 1, 1897, which
amount should therefore be deducted from the total sum for
appropriations for service as not properly a charge upon the
current work of the office, leaving the excess of fees earned over
appropriations used for service $125,675.39 for the eight and
one-half years.
</p>

<p>
The copyright fees are not, however, the most valuable assets of
the office. During the year the articles deposited and credited
numbered 213,498 articles. This large deposit of books,
periodicals, maps, music, engravings, photographs, etc., includes
many articles of considerable value which the Library of Congress
would otherwise be required to purchase, and these articles
therefore represent an annual acquisition of property to the value
of many thousands of dollars.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. But they do not produce any money.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. They do not produce any money&mdash;that is so; but
they save you making an appropriation. This saves the Appropriations
Committees of both House and Senate from appropriating money each year
to buy these things that you would otherwise have to buy to place upon
the shelves of the Library. Now, I want to do my share, and I want my
business to do its share, toward supporting this Government. But I do
not think, in view of this report, that there is any good reason why
this great, rich Government should place this increased burden upon our
industry.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Do you not argue unfairly when you undertake to
bring in the Library as against the proposition?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. I am not trying to bring in the Library as against
the proposition. Every author has to file two copies of his book, and
they are placed in the Library. I say that if they did not do that, Mr.
Putnam, the Librarian, would have to take money out of his
appropriation and buy these books. I should suppose that that would be
so. Otherwise he would not say that they were of great value. I am
willing, if they want to make a certificate of every view we have and
send to us, for any convenience of the office, to take them; but to
force us to pay for thousands and thousands of certificates, which will
make it impossible for us to make a profit in the manufacture of our
goods at the close margin under which the business is conducted under
our contracts, would be a hardship, and I do not believe you want to
drive us out of business in that way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. We certainly do not want to drive you out of
business.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. It seems to me that it would have that effect.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. But I take it that the Librarian's purpose was to
try to make this thing pay its way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. I have no doubt about that. Mr. Putnam and Mr.
Solberg have told me that by this consolidation of subjects many
certificates could be saved. I should be glad to comply with their
suggestion if our business was of such a character that we could do
this series work; but you can see the difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. We want to be as clear as possible, and to meet
this difficulty. Let me ask you this: Do you not do any series work, or
is it only that you do not do work in a series under this limitation as
to pose or composition?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. We do not do that class of work.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. If the words "only in pose or composition" were
stricken out, would there be a material reduction in your fees? In the
first place, it seems to me that it would be convenient for us to
know&mdash;how many copyright entries do you make in the course of a year?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. I can not tell.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Have you any idea?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. It varies with different years.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Would it run up into thousands?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Some years I think it does.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. If you were privileged to register under one fee
works in a series&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. But what would be a "series?" That is the
question.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Representing the same subject.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Representing the same subject under the same title
with only slight variances, but not the variances described here as
"only in pose or composition." What we would like to know is, would it
enable you to enter a great many of these articles under one fee that
you now enter separately?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. That depends upon what you call the same subject.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Is seems to me that you would have to introduce
the word "general;" that is, make it read "the same general subject."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. If you introduce that who will decide what is the
same general subject, except the courts? It would encourage law suits.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. It would be the Librarian, would it not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. His decision would not be final. The law says we
can go to the courts and test his construction.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. It would be the Librarian, so far as your fees
were concerned?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. Yes; but we do not want to pay a fee unless it is
to be registered in such a way that the court will hold that we have a
legal registration. We have an artist in San Francisco; and if we could
register under one entry all the views that he will take in San
Francisco while he is there, which will probably be 500 different
subjects, for half a dollar, we would like to do it. But what subjects
that he takes in San Francisco can we include as a series and have
protected? He will take the Pacific Hotel, showing its ruin and present
condition, and he may take a Chinese camp, and he may take the Flood
Building, and so on. How many can we get into a series and have the
court protect us when we come to try a case? That is the difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Suppose this said you shall enter under a series all churches in
Paris&mdash;under one entry fee, for 50 cents&mdash;that we may enter all
negatives that we take of churches there. How will you describe it in
your entry upon the book? Suppose we go to Rome, where they have 365
Catholic churches; they are not grouped in any way; we can not pose
them. How will you describe the 365 views? Will you describe them as
365 views of the churches of Rome, or will you specify them under one
head? You can see the difficulties, gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Do you not publish those in series for selling
purposes sometimes?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. No. In selling we do this: We have a pictorial
illustration of the Holy Land. It includes perhaps fifty pictures, but
it covers the whole of the Holy Land. One is taken in Jerusalem, one in
Jaffa, and one at Damascus, for instance. We should be glad to comply
with any law that will protect us and not inject doubts into our
business and encourage piracy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Mr. Webb desires to know if this amendment would
take care of your matter: "Insert after 'seal,' in line 6, page 37, the
words 'provided only 50 cents shall be charged for each stereoscopic
view filed and registered.'"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. That is all right. And if we want a certificate in
our business, we will come and, as the old lady said, "heave down our
50 cents and get it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. "<i>Provided</i>, That in the case of stereoscopic
views the certificate should not be furnished unless required, and in
that case the fee shall be," etc.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. And in such case no certificate shall be issued
unless the regular fee is paid.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Remich</span>. That is perfectly satisfactory; but any attempt to
define by series is sure to be unsatisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I think you may be right about this matter of
series.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF A. BELL MALCOMSON, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I intend, Mr. Chairman, to be brief. The
remarks that I shall make are pertinent more to correct the law so as
to make it more definite than for any other purpose. I have prepared a
short statement of just what the changes I propose are. The matter is
one relating to lithographs. I represent Mr. McLaughlin, or McLaughlin
Brothers, who are probably the largest lithographers in the country.
Mr. McLaughlin has spent millions in perfecting that art in this
country. He, unfortunately, is abroad at the present time, and has
asked me to be here to represent him.
</p>

<p>
Lithographs have always been mentioned in the former copyright bills. A
lithograph is something different from any other production of a
picture or of any pictorial illustration. But in this case it has been
thought by the framers of the bill that the words "print or pictorial
illustration" would cover lithographs.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Please refer to the section of the bill that you
wish to call attention to.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I am referring to page 4, line 4.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. "Prints and pictorial illustrations?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. Yes. The word "lithograph" is not mentioned in
the subjects of copyright. It has always heretofore been mentioned. The
suggestion that I find in the little memorandum that was attached in
relation to the bill is: "It is assumed, however, that these will be
included under the more general terms as prints and pictorial
illustrations;" that is, that lithographs, it is presumed by the
framers of this bill, will be included under that term.
</p>

<p>
Lithographs, as I say, are something entirely different from any other
production, and I do not think&mdash;and I hope the committee will agree
with me&mdash;that they are entirely and specifically included. Lithographs
are not included under that term.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Mallory</span>. How about engravings?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. Engravings are prints. The lithographic process
is something different from the mere printing from an engraving. The
lithographic process is a very peculiar and a very interesting one. It
would take too long for me to go into it and describe it, but it is
entirely different from printing. The use of the colors, the manner in
which the ink or the color is transferred from the stone to the paper,
is not the mere act of printing. The color, I will say in brief, is
held there by, as it were, grease. Grease forms a material component in
the practicing of the lithographic process.
</p>

<p>
The matter of lithographs has always been mentioned. The subject of
lithographing has always been mentioned in previous bills, and not only
that, but in this bill the lithographic process is specifically
mentioned, and I shall come to that next. But the suggestion now is
that there is a sufficient difference between lithographs and all other
prints and pictorial illustrations to warrant the word "lithographs"
being inserted there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Then you would insert, after the word "prints,"
in line 4, on page 4, the word "lithographs?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. Yes, sir. That is my proposition. I do that
because particularly in a late decision of great importance, made by
the circuit court of appeals in our second circuit, they have used this
language&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. That is the decision that has already been put
in the record?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I think it has. It has been handed in to the
committee. A printed copy of it has been loaned to me, and I will read
an extract from it to show the pertinency of my remarks about
interpolating this word "lithograph:"
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
But in view of the fact that the law of copyright is a creature of
statute and is not declaratory of the common law, and that it
confers distinctive and limited rights which did not exist at the
common law, we are constrained to hold that it must be strictly
construed, and that we are not at liberty to extend its provisions,
either by resort to equitable considerations or to a strained
interpretation of the terms of the statute.
</p>
</div>

<p>
I think that I am warranted, in view of that late decision, in asking
the committee to interpolate that word "lithograph."
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. What do you say to that suggestion, Mr. Putnam
and Mr. Solberg?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I prefer that a suggestion as to phraseology in a
section that has been so very carefully considered by our general legal
advisers, these two committees of the bar association, should be
submitted to them for their opinion as to its necessity and effect; and
I think it would not be helpful to the committee to have me give an
offhand opinion upon it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I do not think there is much doubt that that
lithographic process would not be included in merely a pictorial
illustration.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. Or in a print.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Or in a print, either.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. It might possibly be in a print; but a print
might be construed by the courts to be something in which type and ink,
or a plate and ink, is used.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Was this matter taken up at the conferences?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I do not know. I was not present when it was
specifically discussed. I was present at one of the conferences, but
not when this was specifically discussed. I have always urged upon the
Copyright Office, with whom I have colabored in this matter, that it
should be included. And I am now here to stand up for it. I shall ask
leave to be heard again on this, in view of the fact that Mr. Putnam
states that he wishes to discuss it with the parties who drew the bill.
I ask to be heard again at some subsequent hearing.
</p>

<p>
I pass on now to page 8, and the next suggestion that I have to make is
in line 21 on that page. We know from what I have said, or we have an
idea of what a lithographic process is. In this section, which is on
page 8, is the restriction in relation to the printing of books or of
lithographs, which are copyrighted in this country, in a foreign
country and importing them here. That applies to this case. In Germany
they can do this kind of work and beat us out of our boots. We can not
compete with them at all in that line of work. To such an extent is
that so that to-day the pictures of our Capitol, the pictures of all
prominent buildings in our cities, are printed on postcards, and you
will find on these cards a little statement, if you look at it, "Made
in Germany." That is so throughout our cities. They are not
copyrighted, of course. If they were copyrighted they would have a
protection which they do not now have; but that is the fact.
</p>

<p>
In this section 13, on page 8, to which I am referring, there is a
provision that where the book is copyrighted the type shall be set up
in the United States and the book shall be printed in the United
States. I will read section 13, so that we can comprehend it [reading]:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 13.</span> That of a printed book or periodical the text of
the copies deposited under section 11, above, shall be printed from
type set within the limits of the United States, either by hand or
by the aid of any kind of typesetting machine, or from plates made
from type set within the limits of the United States; or if the
text be produced by lithographic process, then by a process wholly
performed within the limits of the United States; which
requirements shall extend also to the illustrations produced by
lithographic process within a printed book consisting of text and
illustrations, and also to separate lithographs&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now follows the matter that I am objecting to: "Except where in either
case"&mdash;that is, in the case of the book being produced by lithographic
process, or in the case of a separate illustration being in the
book&mdash;"except where in either case the subjects represented are located
in a foreign country." Now, the lithographic process is not one in
which a man goes and sets himself down in front of a mountain and works
his process and takes his color scheme from the mountain, or one in
which he goes in front of a building in a foreign city and sets up his
lithographic process and conducts it there, at all. Why that exception?
What is the meaning of it? I have had no explanation of it. I can not
get any. It is said, "Well, the picture may represent a building in a
foreign country or foreign scenery." Not at all.
</p>

<p>
There is no necessity for that exception in those cases. If a foreign
scene is to be reproduced by a lithographic process, a photograph is
taken of it in the foreign country, or a sketch is taken of it in the
foreign country. The color scheme is then developed by the artist,
possibly there, but no part of the lithographic process is necessary to
be conducted in the foreign country at all. It is brought over here,
and in the factory, in the print works in Brooklyn or Detroit or some
other part of the United States, the lithographic process is then
practiced.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. What effect does this section have?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. It would have the effect of throwing into the
hands of the German lithographer all lithographic work in relation to
pictures or paintings which related to any foreign city or foreign
landscape. That is what the result of that exception would be. Every
foreign landscape, every foreign building that is depicted by a
lithograph under that section is outside of the restrictions of this
section 13. That is what that means. You can not reason it out any
other way; and that is the reason we except to it. We say we are
properly protected by section 13, and that that exception should come
out.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. As you explain it, I think it ought to.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Just what do you want to strike out?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I want to strike out those words that I have
read. If the committee will be kind enough to mark the words, I will
read them, on line 21, page 8: "Except where, in either case, the
subjects represented are located in a foreign country." That ought to
come out, for two reasons. It is ambiguous&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It would not occur to me that it is ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. Well, it is pretty straight, I think, in one
way.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Where is your next point?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. The next one, if the committee please, is on
page 14, line 15. That is exactly to the same import as the one on page
4, because it inserts the word "lithograph" after the work "print," you
will see.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You think it should be inserted there after the
word "print," again?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. Yes. The same argument that I made before will
apply to that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. If it needs to be in the other place, it should
be put in here, also.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. That is all that I have to offer. I am
exceedingly obliged to you for your attention.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Just a moment. I understood your objection on
that page 4 and this last one is that the word "print" does not cover a
lithograph?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. My objection is that it is a question&mdash;that it
would leave a question for the courts; and in so far as it is really
meant to be there, and we have had a decision of one of our highest
courts of appeal, unless they get a writ of error and go to the Supreme
Court of the United States, using the language that I have just read to
you in relation to this copyright law, that it is a statutory law, and
that it must be construed strictly&mdash;with those facts before me, I urge
upon the committee that we do not leave that question open.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. What I wanted to inquire was just this: Do you
not understand that the word "print" in its ordinary significance and
meaning in the dictionary covers the lithograph?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I understand that a "lithographic print" is a
proper term; but I understand that that word "print" might be construed
as not broad enough to cover a lithographic print. There are prints
from engravings. They are prints; and in the old law, we have the word
"cut." "Cut" and "print" are substantially the same, and there is a
decision, which I have not gone into, because I do not want to take up
any more time than I can help&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I see no objection to inserting the word
"lithographs," if there is any doubt about it at all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. What I want is information as to whether or not,
in his experience, it is not already covered by the word "print." Under
the ordinary definition in the dictionary, it seems to be perfectly
covered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That decision that he referred to a while ago
leaves it somewhat in doubt.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I wrote a 15-page brief once on that part of
the statute which related to "cuts" and "print" and discussed the
subject most thoroughly; and it made me feel that we ought to have the
word "lithograph" in there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Can you tell us whether in case the word
"lithograph" is put in there, it might be necessary to put in the words
"etching" and "engraving?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. No.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. You make an entire distinction, as I understand
it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. Yes; an etching and an engraving would come
under a pictorial illustration, without any question. An etching is a
pictorial illustration of a subject, certainly, and an engraving is a
pictorial illustration of a subject; but a lithograph, when the word is
used subsequently in the law, it seems to me should have a place in the
section which provides protection for certain subjects.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. I find here that in the dictionary, under the
noun "print," is this definition:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
1. An impression with ink from type, plates, etc.; printed
characters collectively; printed matter; as, small print; the print
is illegible.
</p>

<p>
2. Anything printed from an engraved plate or lithographic
stone&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Malcomson</span>. I agree with you that the courts might hold
that that was sufficient to cover it&mdash;that the word "print" would cover
a lithograph, and I should contend so before the court; but it is this
late decision which leads me to feel that, in so much as it is not
going to do any harm, why should we leave it out? Why should we leave
it out?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Are there any other gentlemen to be heard now?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. A. Beverly Smith, speaking for the
Reproductive Arts Copyright League, and particularly for certain groups
of lithographers, simply desired me to say that he thinks also that the
word "lithographs" should go in, but that it should go in in a separate
subsection, and should be coupled with the word "posters." On the other
hand, I ought, to complete the record of this day, to call your
committee's attention to a communication from Mr. Ansley Wilcox, which
has been presented to the committee. He was here in behalf of an
establishment that gets out lithographs, and particularly posters, and
he was at the conference particularly concerned about the protection of
that material. He writes, and his letter has already gone down to be
put in the record, or I should read it; but substantially this, that he
considers the specifications of those subsections as very liberal and
fully covering all that he is interested in. This is simply for your
information.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">A. Beverly Smith</span>. May I correct the statement of the
Librarian, Mr. Chairman? I do not think it is necessary that the word
"lithographs" should go in there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I beg pardon, then. I thought you did.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">A. Beverly Smith</span>. I agree with the statement made to you
by the Librarian regarding consultation with your legal advisers as to
whether or not it should be put in. If you decide to put it in, I think
it would be much wiser not to couple it with prints and pictorial
illustrations at all, but to make a separate classification. And if you
do decide, after consultation, to put lithographs in, I think that that
will also require the word "posters" to be put in. I personally do not
believe that either one is necessary to be defined separately.
</p>

<p>
(Thereupon the committee adjourned until to-morrow, Friday, June 8,
1906, at 10 o'clock, a.m.)

<i>Friday, June, 8, 1906</i>.
</p>

<p>
The committee met at 10 o'clock a.m., conjointly with the Senate
Committee on Patents.
</p>

<p>
Present: Senators Kittredge (chairman), Smoot, and Latimer;
Representatives Currier, Campbell, Chaney, McGavin, Webb, and Southall.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Mr. Solberg, yesterday, when Mr. Cutter was
testifying, I asked him this question: "Can you import two copies of an
unauthorized edition?" He said, "Yes, sir." I asked, "Can you do that
to-day?" He answered, "Yes, sir; we can now." I asked, then, "A
fraudulent reprint, for instance?" "Yes, sir." "There is absolutely no
restriction, as you understand it, to-day?" "There is no restriction at
all, as I understand it, to-day."
</p>

<p>
I would like to ask you if you understand the practice to be as Mr.
Cutter states?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. The prohibition of importation was introduced
into the copyright law by the act of March 3, 1891, and it was a
prohibition of importation additional or extra to that which is
supposed to have existed in copyright law against any unauthorized
copies. The law as it stood prior to that provided that these
unauthorized copies could only be permitted importation upon the
consent of the copyright proprietor. That is, the author himself or the
copyright proprietor could import even a fraudulent copy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That was prior to 1891?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. Yes. But in the act of March 3, 1891, it is
stated, in connection with the typesetting clause, that copies of books
not printed from type set within the limits of the United States or
from plates made therefrom shall not be imported: and then certain
exceptions are introduced, and one is an exception directly on behalf
of the individual buyer. The other exceptions are on behalf of
libraries, which consist in paragraphs of the free list of the tariff
act taken over into the copyright law. It is therefore a matter of
interpretation of the law what the interpolation of these exceptions
means. Now, I can not authoritatively give that interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I would like your understanding of the practice
since the law of 1891.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. Perhaps the best light I can throw on that is the
statement that there is an opinion from the Department of Justice, the
Attorney-General, that the exceptions would not bar an unauthorized
copy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Then you understand that Mr. Cutter is right in
what he says?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. I would understand it so far as that decision or
opinion would be supported and would be taken as final.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Is there any opinion in conflict with that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. There are a number of opinions, none directly in
conflict; none directly upsetting that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Do you know what the practice of the Treasury
Department is now?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. No; I am not competent, I think, to say; but Mr.
Montgomery could answer that question if he is here, because it comes
under the collector of customs.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. If there is any gentleman present who has
information on that subject and can answer that question we would be
glad to hear from him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Montgomery was here yesterday; I think he will
be here a little later. I think it might be helpful, if you will permit
me to suggest, Mr. Chairman, as pertinent (it goes beyond your
question, but is relevant in connection with it), as to whether such
importation is, according to the register's information of foreign
legislation, customary abroad&mdash;such privilege of importation of an
unauthorized foreign edition of a book printed in the foreign country
under domestic law there?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. My purpose in seeking this information is to
establish the fact, if it be a fact, where you provide that the
importation must be an authorized edition, whether that is a change in
law or not, a change in practice, whether it is an additional
restriction. That is what I was trying to get at. I have asked a number
of times whether subdivision E, at the top of page 16, "To any book
published abroad with the authorization of the author or copyright
proprietor," etc., changes existing law and is an additional
restriction upon importation; that is all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. You see, the question is difficult of answering
categorically, Mr. Chairman, because it is a question of the
interpretation of a complex statute.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. From the present interpretation of the law
there is not any doubt in the world, then, but what this is a
restriction?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. I should say that this act attempts to make clear
that all fraudulent copies are barred.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. That is a restriction, then?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Solberg</span>. As a protection of the copyright.
</p>

<p>
(The following communication from the register of copyrights is printed
in connection with his above remarks by direction of the chairman:)
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
<span class="sc">Library of Congress, Copyright Office</span>,
<br><i>Washington, D.C., June 15, 1906</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>: I ask to be allowed to file for the
printed report of the hearing on the copyright bill the following, in
addition to my answers to the questions you asked me on Friday, June 8,
in relation to the importation of copies of unauthorized editions of
American books: </p>

<p> 1. It is fundamental to the protection of copyright that all
unauthorized reprints of copyrighted books shall be prohibited
importation into the country of origin. It is therefore provided in all
foreign copyright legislation that such unauthorized copies shall be
prohibited importation. Such copies are treated as fraudulent copies,
and I know of no provisions in any foreign legislation which permit
importation of unauthorized copies either by individuals, educational
or other institutions, or libraries. </p>

<p> In the copyright legislation of the United States prior to 1891,
the provisions prohibiting importation dealt only with unauthorized
copies and these were prohibited importation, except with the direct
consent in writing of the author or copyright proprietor. </p>

<p> 2. The act of March 3, 1891, introduced an additional prohibition
of importation, namely, of copies of authorized editions of foreign
copyrighted books, or of authorized foreign reprints of American
copyright books, unless printed from type set within the limits of the
United States or from plates made therefrom. </p>

<p> To this prohibition of importation certain exceptions were enacted
in favor of private book buyers, educational institutions, and
libraries; and some paragraphs of the free list of the act of October
1, 1890 (permitting importation without the payment of duty) were taken
over into the copyright law to insure that the articles named in these
paragraphs should be included in the exceptions to the prohibition of
importation of copies of authorized editions of books. </p>

<p> It was not supposed that Congress intended that these exceptions to
the prohibition of importation should apply to unauthorized editions,
but upon the matter being submitted to the Department of Justice an
opinion was filed by the Solicitor-General ruling that the exceptions
did extend to unauthorized reproductions of American books. (See
Opinion of Holmes Conrad, April 19, 1895; Synopsis of Treasury
Decisions for 1895, pp. 495-498.) </p>

<p> 3. In the provisions of the new bill dealing with importation a
careful distinction has been maintained between unauthorized
(fraudulent) copies and copies of authorized editions not printed from
type set within the limits of the United States. </p>

<p> In the case of all unauthorized reprints of books the prohibition
of importation is absolute, and any such copies introduced into the
United States are subject to seizure, forfeiture, and destruction. (See
sections 26 to 29 of the bill.) In the case of copies of authorized
editions not set in the United States, such copies if imported are
seized and exported, but not destroyed. (See copyright bill, sec. 31.)
</p>

<p> All exceptions, therefore, to the prohibition of importation of
authorized editions in the bill concern only authorized copies, and
there is no permission in favor of any one to import any unauthorized,
pirated copies. </p>

<p>

</div>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. It seems that a Mr. Davis, who represents some
manufacturers of musical devices, does not understand that he is to
have any part of the hour assigned to the gentlemen mentioned
yesterday. Is Mr. Davis here?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I think Mr. Davis has not yet come in.
</p>

<p>
With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I will state as to the letter of
Mr. Wilcox, to which I referred yesterday in connection with the
suggestion from Mr. Malcomson as to the need of including lithographs
in the specification of subject-matter, that the passage which I should
have read if I had had the letter here (it was with the stenographer)
was this:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
I congratulate you that the bill has taken this definite form and is
now to be given a preliminary hearing, so that it will be in shape to
be urged for passage next winter. The bill is a monument to the
industry and broad intelligence and information of those who have been
actively concerned in drafting it. <span class="asterisk">* * *</span>
As affecting the interest of my client, the Consolidated Lithograph
Company, which is a large producer of lithographic and other prints,
engravings, etc., especially for use as posters, the form of the bill
seems satisfactory to me, and I have no doubt it will be so to my
client. This refers particularly to the provisions of sections 4 and 5,
defining the subject-matter of copyright and the form of applications
for registration. These provisions are in the highest degree liberal
and enlightened.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The copyright office has received a communication from Mr. Fritz von
Briesen, requesting that in section 5, after line 7, a further
subdivision, "Miscellaneous," be inserted, and that the following be
added:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>And provided furthermore</i>, That a series of maps, drawings,
photographs, prints, and pictorial illustrations, and labels and
prints relating to articles of manufacture, and other subjects of
copyright of an artistic nature, constituting a unit or assembled
for a unitary purpose, shall be considered as the subject-matter of
a single copyright registration, should the applicant so elect,
whether or not they are actually joined by binding, printing on the
same sheet of material, or otherwise.
</p>
</div>

<p>
I suggest this, Mr. Chairman, as appropriate to be inserted in
connection with the discussion of the fees yesterday by Mr. Remicher.
It bears on that point.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. That will go in the record.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I handed in, I believe, yesterday, a statement in
writing from Mr. A. W. Elson, of Boston, making certain specific
recommendations for changes. He telegraphs me, "Written presentation
sent you fully covers my view."
</p>

<p>
That is in answer to an inquiry as to whether he wished to have a
hearing before the committee.
</p>

<p>
I have received a communication from the International Brotherhood of
Bookbinders, as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
As president of Local No. 4, of Bookbinders' Union, of this city, and
representative of the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders of the
United States, I would be pleased to be heard on the Currier copyright
bill to-morrow, immediately after Mr. J. J. Sullivan has spoken on
bill. I will not consume more than ten minutes, and possibly less than
that. I will be in attendance at the hearing.
</p>

<p>
Very respectfully,
</p>

<p class="sig">
J. L. <span class="sc">Feeney</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The office has received, since the bill was introduced, from the Music
Publishers' Association, certain proposed amendments, additional
provisions in connection with the protection of the copyright on
musical compositions. These, I should advise the chairman, have not
been communicated to the gentlemen who are to speak in opposition to
any of those provisions. They have not had them, therefore, before them
in preparing their case this morning at all; and while I have
manifolded copies here which are at their disposal, it is to be
understood that these were not communicated to them. On the other hand,
Mr. Serven, who in behalf of the music publishers handed these to me,
states (if I am not correct, Mr. Serven, you will correct me) that
these contain additional specifications but in the same general
direction. That is all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">A. R. Serven</span>. That is correct, Mr. Librarian, and simply
to conform subsection G of section 1 to comply with the recent decision
of the United States circuit court of appeals in the White-Smith
<i>v.</i> Apollo Company case. The same idea is represented simply. The
case was decided, of course, since the bill was printed.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Mr. Putnam, just call our attention to the
proposed change.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. This is contained in a written communication, and
it will really take less time to read it from the communication.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. (Reading:)
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Section 1, subsection G, should be amended to read as follows:
</p>

<p>
"To make, sell, distribute, or let for hire any device, contrivance, or
appliance adapted in any manner whatsoever when used in connection with
any mechanism to reproduce to the ear or to cause the said mechanism to
reproduce to the ear the sounds forming or identifying the whole or any
material part of any work copyrighted after this act shall have gone
into effect, or by means of any such device, contrivance, appliance, or
mechanism publicly to reproduce to the ear the whole or any material
part of such work."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Omitting the explanations, the next amendment will be as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Section 3 should be amended to read as follows:
</p>

<p>
"That the copyright provided by this act shall extend to and protect
all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted, any and
all reproductions or copies thereof, in whatever form, style, or size,
and all matter reproduced therein in which copyright is already
subsisting, and the devices, appliances, or contrivances mentioned in
section 1, subdivision (<i>g</i>) of this act, but without extending
the duration of such copyright."
</p>

<p>
Section 23, subdivision (<i>b</i>)&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. I suppose the other amendments are simply to
follow if the first amendment is approved?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. If the first amendment is approved; that is my
understanding.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Serven</span>. Mr. Chairman, that is true with the exception of
one amendment. The Musical Publishers' Association suggests that the
same right of appeal and review in interlocutory judgments and orders
should be provided for in the new bill as is provided for in the
existing law. That is the only thing that is different.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Horace Pettit</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I ask Mr. Serven whether
he will add to his amended section 3 the clause which I suggested in my
amendment to the original section 3? It would accomplish the same
purpose as I had intended. My suggestion of amendment would also apply
to your amended section 3, which adds:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>And provided</i>, That no devices, contrivances, or appliances, or
dies or matrices for making the same, made prior to the date this act
shall go into effect, shall be subject to any subsisting copyright.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Serven</span>, Yes, Mr. Chairman; I think that is only fair to
the interests represented.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. You accept that as an addition to your amendment?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Serven</span>. We are very glad to, indeed. We think that is
perfectly fair.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. A suggestion was made here the other day, the
first day of the hearings, to strike out section 3, I think.
</p>

<p>
M. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. Well, either that or that my amendment be added to
it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Yes. Who was the gentleman who replied to you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. Mr. Fuller, of New York.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I understood Mr. Fuller to say that the question
of whether subsisting copyrights covered these mechanical devices was
now in the court, and they thought the court might hold that such
devices were now covered. If such should be the decision of the court,
would it not prohibit the use of graphophone cylinders and records
already made and in use, if they were records of music covered by a
subsisting copyright, under that section 3?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. If the decision of the court were such as to
include talking-machine records or other sound records within the
subsisting law, of course it would prohibit that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Does any gentleman here think we ought to
legislate along that line?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. Not that I know of. I do not understand that they
think so, unless Mr. Fuller was misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That would prevent any boy or girl in the country
who has bought records and who is using them to-day from using them.
Immediately, I suppose, a warning circular would go out that they must
not use those records and cylinders that they had bought in good faith.
It does not seem to me that we could pass any such legislation as that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Gentleman.</span> Mr. Chairman, that is exactly the position of a
great many of the interests involved and exactly the position on which
we wish to be heard here to-day.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I do not think you need spend much time in
talking about subsisting copyrights.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. The intent of this act is to make it apply to
compositions copyrighted after this act goes into effect.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I understand that another section provides that;
but it must be in conflict with this section if the courts should hold
as Mr. Fuller thinks they may.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. But the amendment to section 3 should be that the
devices and contrivances mentioned in subdivision (<i>g</i>) shall
apply only to compositions copyrighted after this act shall have gone
into effect, and say nothing about subsisting copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. It can be readily modified to suit that. There is
not any question that we do not want to make it retroactive.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Mr. Putnam, is Mr. Davis here now?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Davis is here. Mr. Davis, it is necessary to
know how the hour assigned to particular opponents of the music
provision, or a group of them, is to be apportioned, and whether the
statement that you are to submit is part of that or not. They
understand that it is distinct from the group of statements by them,
and they also state that they understood that you understood that, and
that your statement would be brief, something like fifteen minutes. I
ask in behalf of the Chairman as to this understanding. Whom do you
represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Inventors as a class of their own, and distinct
from manufacturers.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. No particular establishment?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. No, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. And no particular association?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. No, sir.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. How much time do you wish, Mr. Davis?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. About 20 minutes.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You may proceed, Mr. Davis.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF G. HOWLETT DAVIS, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Will you not state your name and who you
represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. My name is G. Howlett Davis. I have been an
inventor during all of my majority and represent inventors as a class.
I hope to show how the passage of this act will, first, discourage
invention; second, restrict patent grants already held by inventors;
third, provide authority to confiscate an inventor's physical property;
fourth, to abrogate the inventor's constitutional rights, and, fifth,
to create a monopoly which would be practically controlled by a few to
the detriment of inventors and the public.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there are a good many subjects to take up here in the
limited time allowed me, and I am willing to take them up in any order
you may designate.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. I think it only fair that in your case as well
as that of the other gentlemen the time devoted to questions should not
be considered as part of your time, and taken out of your time; but I
would like to ask one or two questions before you begin. Do you
understand that this bill proposes to interfere with existing patent
rights?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Vested rights?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir. I shall take that up first, if you
please.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. You mean, then, that section 3 is the section
that interferes with them?
</p>

<p>
(Mr. Davis looks for the bill.)
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. If you have not it there, do not bother about
looking for it now. Go right on.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. I had a marked copy here.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. We will listen to you when you come to that
section, anyhow.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You may proceed, Mr. Davis, and we will not
interrupt you during your twenty minutes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Thank you, sir.
</p>

<p>
I would like to first explain that I am here without counsel and
without any previous notice from the Copyright Office, and without
invitation from any source whatever. I discovered the existence of the
proposed bill by mere accident on Saturday last. I was then notified
that a firm which operates under my patents would have to go out of
business if this law passed, and would necessarily have to cancel its
licenses with me. That concern is the Perforated Music Roll Company,
with offices at 25 West Twenty-third street, New York City. I have also
just to-day received similar intimation from another concern
manufacturing under my patents in Philadelphia, the Electrelle Company,
just organized for a million dollars for the manufacture under my
patents for reproducing music mechanically.
</p>

<p>
I have been inventing in numerous classes during the last twenty years,
including printing presses, typesetting machines, typewriting machines,
clocks, stencil duplicating apparatus, etc., but about ten years ago I
took up the class of self-playing musical instruments. I recognized
that there was a peculiar relation of this art to copyrighted musical
compositions, and I saw that in some way whatever devices I might
invent for the reproduction of music mechanically might interfere with
the composer's rights, because music is a necessary component part of
the class of self-playing musical instruments, and you all know that
this industry has become one of the greatest of the young industries of
the country. You can take up any magazine and you will see many pages
filled with descriptions of self-playing musical devices, including
phonographs, graphophones, apollos, angeluses, cecilians, pianophones,
and a hundred other devices for reproducing music automatically. As far
as I am able to ascertain none of these concerns have had notice of
this bill, and the two concerns who are operating under my patents not
only have had no notice, but have notified me, as before stated, that
in case of the passage of the bill they will have to annul their
contracts with me.
</p>

<p>
From dire necessity I was compelled to work for two years with the
Æolian Company, a concern which attempted to take from me without due
consideration inventions which I believe have since been recognized as
superior to their instrument, the pianola. During the St. Louis
exposition the Government officials sought for a self-playing device
which would represent the highest advancement of the art. Among others
they considered the pianola, manufactured by the Æolian Company, and
they also went further and considered the inventions of poor inventors
who had no backing; and finally they selected my device as the sole
exhibit. It was the only self-playing musical instrument which was
exhibited in the Government building during the St. Louis exposition.
</p>

<p>
After I left the Æolian Company, declining to accept the compensation
which they offered me, they have persecuted me in the courts for years.
Moreover, as I can prove to you if you will only give me time to
produce the documents from my attorneys (I waited for them until the
last minute this morning), this concern, failing to secure a monopoly
or strangle my invention through the courts, and recognizing, as a
result of the Government and other indorsements of it, that it would in
time be universally recognized as a superior instrument, has connived
with music publishers and secured from nearly every member of the Music
Publishers' Association a contract which sets forth that in case the
music rolls or records are decided by the courts to come within the
copyright laws, they will take over from them the exclusive right of
reproducing their music for a compensation. These contracts I have seen
with my own eyes. I can swear that they exist, but unfortunately I can
not produce them this morning. But I will agree to produce at least two
of them if you will give me a week's time to do it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You will have the necessary time to put anything
of that kind in the record.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. I thank you. Now, the Æolian Company, being back of
the independent members of the Music Publishers' Association, have
influenced in turn the music publishers as an association to insert in
this bill clauses which will cover mechanical methods of reproducing
music; and in proof of this I will say that as a result of Mr.
Solberg's kindness yesterday afternoon in allowing me to search the
records of the star-chamber proceedings presided over by the Librarian
of Congress, that the first introduction of those clauses was made by
Mr. Bacon for the Music Publishers' Association in the form of an
amendment which now appears in all of its substantial terms as
subdivision (<i>g</i>) page 2, of the bill. Now, the independent music
publishers in turn control the great majority of composers, so that
there is thus formed a complete monopolistic octopus, in which the
Æolian Company forms the head and brains, the Music Publishers'
Association the body, the independent publishers the writhing arms, and
the composers the suckers and baiters. [Applause.]
</p>

<p>
The Æolian Company is a ten-million-dollar concern whose monopolistic
game has already been uncovered in several courts, as I will show by
proofs, and the music publishers are here to pull its chestnuts out of
the fire. [Applause.]
</p>

<p>
Now, if the inventors of this country knew what was in this bill there
would be enough here to fill up every room in this great building, but
they do not know it. It will strike them like a thunderbolt out of a
clear sky when they learn that there are clauses in this bill which not
only seem to lessen or destroy the scope and commercial value of our
existing patent and confiscate our physical property, etc., but also
imprison us in case we infringe the proposed copyright act.
</p>

<p>
Now I will read you from&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. What is your first subheading there that you are
going to talk from?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. That it will discourage invention, but I would like
to take up this bill first; I would like to take it a little out of set
up in my preamble.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Subdivision (<i>g</i>) on page 2?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Subdivision (<i>b</i>) on page 1.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. All right; "To sell, distribute, exhibit, or let
for hire," etc.?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I do not see how that touches your industry.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. No, sir; I had my marked copy here&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I should say "(<i>g</i>)" was the first one that
would affect you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir "(<i>g</i>);" you are right, Mr. Currier.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That is, "To make, sell, distribute, or let for
hire any device, contrivance," etc.?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. "To make, sell, distribute, or let for hire any
device, contrivance, or appliance especially adapted in any manner
whatsoever to reproduce to the ear the whole or any material part of
any work published and copyrighted after this act shall have gone into
effect, or by means of any such device or appliance publicly to
reproduce to the ear the whole or any material part of such work."
</p>

<p>
Now, in this art of self-playing musical instruments alone I have been
granted some twenty-seven patents by this country, and have also been
granted patents all over the world. My patents read very similar to
this&mdash;that I shall have the exclusive right to make, use, and sell the
mechanical contrivance covered by the claims of those patents, and
those claims embody, in connection with the mechanism, a perforated
roll, which is a controller for the instrument, and is an essential
part of it, and in the case of phonographs or graphophones they include
the engraved record.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding that I have gone ahead in good faith under the reading
of the Constitution and the laws as construed by the courts right up to
date, that composers shall be limited to their "writings," intimating
thereby that we inventors should have the right to any methods that we
might discover for mechanically reproducing music&mdash;notwithstanding that
I have expended years of effort and all my money, time, and labor to
devise these machines, and have built models and exhibited them, and
companies have been formed around them&mdash;and notwithstanding that my
patents give me the exclusive right to make, use, and sell these
machines, this proposed act comes out and says that "any device
especially adapted in any manner whatsoever to reproduce to the ear the
whole or any material part of any published and copyrighted work after
this act shall have gone into effect," etc., shall be illegal, and
subjects me to all those hardships enumerated in my preamble, and
transfers to the copyrighter in almost the exact words of my patent
those rights given me by the Commissioner of Patents under the
authority of the Constitution.
</p>

<p>
I am not a lawyer, and never made a public speech before in my life,
and can only speak to you out of the fullness of my heart. I have not
even been able to get my counsel here&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I do not think you need any. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. After destroying or limiting the patent rights
already vested in me as explained, and transferring them in whole or
part to the copyrighter, as contemplated in subsection (<i>g</i>), page
2, in the bill, I am, by another part of the bill, liable to
imprisonment if I infringe a copyrighted composition, and this I will
do of necessity if I proceed under the authority of my existing patents
giving me the exclusive right to make, use, and sell my mechanical
device for reproducing music, whether copyrighted or not, thus through
two conflicting grants, one to the composer and the other to me, I may
innocently&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Not if you do it innocently. If you read it
carefully you will find that that is the case.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. There is a paragraph further over, section 25, page
18, which provides that anyone who shall knowingly and willfully
infringe the proposed copyright "shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by
imprisonment for not exceeding one year." Now, if I proceed "willfully"
to exercise my full rights as vested in me by my existing patents in
defiance of the conflicting and unconstitutional copyright grant
proposed, then the copyrighter can put me in jail for a year and during
my incarceration and during the entire life of my patents make, use,
and sell my machines under the provisions of subsection (<i>g</i>). It
is no misdemeanor for one inventor to infringe the patents of another
inventor, no matter how frequent and willful such infringements may be;
then why imprison an inventor for infringing a usurping copyrighter.
Supposing such infringements are innocently made, then wealthy and
unscrupulous corporations, such as the Æolian Company, through their
unscrupulous lawyers, will succeed in jailing many poor and innocent
inventors. It is hard enough now for most inventors to keep out of the
poorhouse and the courts; don't add to their present hardships.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Mr. Davis, of course you mean that that would
happen if you published something after the passage of this act that
was copyrighted? This act plainly says, in section G: "Any work
published and copyrighted after this act shall have gone into effect."
It does not affect anything at all that you have done before?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes; but it applies to machines that I have already
invented and which I may use after this act, according to my patent, to
mechanically reproduce any music of the past, present, or future.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. It does not apply to pieces that you play on those
machines now, though, even if they are now copyrighted, does it? It
only applies to pieces copyrighted after this act goes into effect.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. My machines, those that I have been inventing and
patenting for years, are specially adapted to reproduce, or may be
specially adapted and arranged to reproduce any particular piece,
whether copyrighted to-day or hereafter. Under the Constitution, as I
understand it, I have the right to use anything that is not a writing,
a readable writing; and I have gone ahead under the Constitution with
the full reward therein provided as an incentive for my work. The bill
covers not only pieces or controller records, but also the machines
which they actuate.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You do not understand, though, Mr. Davis, that this
act will destroy any of your vested rights at present, do you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. I do, sir; as I have explained, though perhaps not
clearly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. When it says that it shall only apply to works
published and copyrighted in the future? It only applies to works
copyrighted and published after this act goes into effect, and I do not
see how it can affect any vested right which you have on account of
your past investments.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. But the idea of inventions is to be able to produce
a mechanism which can be specially adapted to any music, whether of
to-day or to-morrow. My patent grant does not except new copyrighted
pieces.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. I understand that; but there are two propositions
involved here. The first is, you say it will destroy what you have
already invented. The next is, you say it will destroy you because of
your inability to get hold of these pieces that will be published and
copyrighted in the future. Is that your point, now? Is that your
argument?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. I say that this practically depreciates or destroys
the marketable value of my inventions or machines, which are capable of
being used for mechanically reproducing either old or new music, as
well as destroying in part or whole my existing patent rights.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Because it will not let you reproduce works
published and copyrighted in the future? Is that the reason, now, why
you say it will destroy your invention?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; coupling this admission with my previous
explanations.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. I wanted to get your meaning.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Or, in other words, if Mr. Sousa should have a
very popular air or piece produced in the future, you think that you
ought, as you have in the past, to simply be permitted to reproduce
that by your machine?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; either I or any other patentee.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Without any consideration whatever?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir, I do; because outside of a possible minor
and remote ethical or equity right, he possesses not a vestige of a
statutory or legal right to stop me.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. And whatever his brain, and his talent, and his
gift has brought forward, you are entitled to use?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. And I want to go ahead and explain, if you will
allow me, why I say that.
</p>

<p>
Before I took up this art of self-playing musical instruments, as I
said, I saw that there was a possible limitation, and that in order to
make inventions commercially successful I would have to use musical
compositions. If I used old music, they would be useless. I would have
to use current music; and I read the Constitution, and the very first
article of the Constitution that I came to, section 8, reads:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That the Congress shall have power to promote the progress of science
and useful arts by securing, for limited times, to authors and
inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Mr. Sousa insists on that, too. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Yes; I was going to say, that is just exactly
what Professor Sousa insists upon.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That is where the other fellows claim they come
in.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. There is where Mr. Sousa and the trust, on one
side, and I are going to lock horns&mdash;right here with the Constitution
as our battle ground.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. Would you like to amend that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. No, sir; I want the Constitution to stand as it is.
It is not the construction Mr. Sousa puts on this word "writing"
therein; it is not the construction that I put on it; but I followed
this matter down, as an inventor. Every decision that has ever been
made in this country and England, as I read it, has limited that word
"writing" to mean some visible and readable writing; not the mere
making of a wave in the air. If I invent improvements in wireless
telegraphy, the Government does not grant me anything but the
mechanical means of doing that, or the method. It does not give me
exclusive right to use God's free air and vibrate it.
</p>

<p>
For instance, we will imagine Mr. Sousa facing an audience of ten
thousand persons and behind him one hundred skilled musicians who, upon
the movement of Mr. Sousa's baton perform in melodious concord upon one
hundred different musical instruments. We will, for illustration, as
audiences do without suggestion, forget the inventors who evolved the
orchestral musical instruments and without which Sousa's band would be
a nonentity, and take under consideration only one of the inventors who
have formed part of the audience which has been enraptured. After the
performance the thought occurs to many that it would be a blessing to
mankind if such music as they had heard could be reproduced at will for
their own pleasure and for that of those who are in remote sections of
the world and for those who are too poor to pay for even the
lowest-priced seat.
</p>

<p>
One of the inventors present determines that he can produce the great
desideration to practice, and from that moment commences to evolve in
his mind thousands of different apparatus which appear to him feasible
for the full achievement thereof. After years of experimenting he is
ready to test a machine which, in some of its structural features,
resemble that of the human organism. The inventor's machine is set up
within the range of the air waves, set in vibration by the instruments
of Sousa's band, and which air waves are escaping into space to be lost
to man forever. The ear-like diaphragm of the instrument is impinged by
and set in motion, and through connecting means resembling the human
oricular bones and nerves there is engraved upon a sensitive surface
not far unlike the material matter of the human brain a record of every
minute vibration of all the one hundred instruments.
</p>

<p>
After the performance no one in the audience, musician though he be,
can simultaneously resound any two instruments, and the majority of the
audience would be hissed if they attempted to resound any one of the
instruments. Not so with the mechanical listener, for it is capable of
resounding simultaneous and accurately all of the 100 instruments, and
upon the expenditure of 50 cents for a copy of the machine-made record
the poor man and his family in every part of the world can, by a slight
movement of his hand, start up his $7 graphophone and thus be amused
and enraptured, all owing to the inventor having caught, preserved, and
provided means for mechanically reproducing the air waves which would
have otherwise have escaped beyond Sousa's power to recall.
Nevertheless, the bill provides that the lost chords must be all
returned to Sousa by the inventor in the form of a royalty.
</p>

<p>
There is no novelty in music, nor vibrating the air as a means of
transmitting musical tones, for&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Long 'ere earth was matter or had form,</p>
<p class="i4">Music out of wind and lightning was borne;</p>
<p>It was thus God solaced nature,</p>
<p class="i4">And her troubles were shorn.</p></div></div>

<p>
Now, defining an ethical or equity right which the inventor might claim
with equal justice against Sousa and other composers, the common people
all over the world, who listen to the mechanically reproduced lost
chords of Sousa's band, do frequently order and pay for the sheet music
score for the piano, banjo, violin, and other instruments which the
purchaser plays or thinks he can play, and upon all these orders
induced by the inventor's machine he is entitled to a commission, which
in actual fact and adjustment would offset the alleged right of the
royalty claimed in this bill. There are many other corelated equity
rights which us inventors might set up but which it would be
impracticable to secure to us.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Mr. Davis, if I may interrupt you, do you claim
that you have the right to take one of Mr. Sousa's compositions and use
it in connection with your mechanical device without compensation to
him?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Under the Constitution and all the laws of the
land, I say yes, decidedly; but I want to explain my contention and the
position of inventors in a little different line of argument.
</p>

<p>
The composer of music never conceives nor produces, and never did in
respect of the actual composition, conceive or produce, any means for
conveying to the ear the musical composition. On the contrary, all such
means from the beginning to the present time are the direct result, not
of authorship, not of composition, but of invention. The composer never
conceives the idea of a mechanical means for playing a piece of music.
That achievement is the result of the effort of the inventor. The
Constitution makes no distinction in respect of right of protection as
between an author and an inventor, but both are coequal under the
Constitution, and the line or field within which each may be protected
is clearly marked out in the Constitution, the result of authorship
being distinctly distinguished from the result of invention. The author
is restricted by the Constitution to protection for "writings" and the
inventor to "discoveries."
</p>

<p>
The courts have determined what may properly come within the
constitutional provision of discoveries, and it has been determined a
number of times that under the constitutional provision a writing does
not include a mechanical contrivance. If the law under discussion be
enacted it will operate to take away from the inventor the rights which
are vouchsafed to him by the Constitution and by the laws of Congress
enacted in pursuance thereof, and deliver his rights over to the author
or composer of a literary production or a musical composition. Such a
procedure would clearly annihilate the inventor, offering him up as a
sacrifice to the author or composer. The Constitution intended no such
thing, and in matter of every right, irrespective of the limitations
provided by the Constitution, Congress ought not to pass a law which
turns the inventor over to the mercy of the author or composer.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to mention to this committee the unprecedented state of
prosperity and material progress attained by this country as the direct
result of invention. In all arts the work of the inventor will be found
at the foundation of the progress and prosperity of the country. The
author or composer has to do more with the pleasure or esthetics of
life, the inventor with the real necessities, and in the art allied to
the fine arts has had to do with placing throughout the United States
in the possession of the common people everywhere the means by which
the composer as composer can never give them. It is not for a moment
intended to detract from the value of the work of the author or
composer, for his work is valuable, but its value has certain
limitations, and these limitations are defined in the Constitution and
acts of Congress heretofore passed in pursuance thereof.
</p>

<p>
The farmer or the workingman in all the small towns of this country,
who are possessed of an electrical piano player or an automatic piano
player, or a graphophone or a phonograph, which serves to relax the
tension of their daily labor and fill their souls with music, is not
because of the composer, for he rarely reached them, but it is the
direct result of the inventor of the mechanical contrivances with which
music may be conveyed. Yet this law attempts to reach out and take away
from the inventor the product of his brain and to deliver it over to
the composer. So far as the mass of the people of this country is
concerned, the work of the composer is infinitesimal as compared with
the work of the inventor, and the inventor is willing that the composer
shall have his just rights under the Constitution; that is to say,
shall have full protection in his writings, but does protest that a law
should not be passed which will enable the composer to overstep the
field of protection to which he is entitled under the Constitution and
usurp that which the Constitution has particularly provided shall be
with the inventor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Would you object to paying a reasonable royalty
to a musical author or the proprietor of the copyright if all companies
would get the right to use that piece of copyrighted music upon the
same terms?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Most assuredly not&mdash;no, sir; I would not,
provided&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You would not object to paying a reasonable
royalty if that right was given to all upon the same terms?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Provisionally I would not object, but your
proposition is one which mainly interests the manufacturers of my
machine, whom I do not represent. As an inventor I approve of the bill
as a whole and only seek to strike out therefrom those comparatively
few words covering mechanical devices, the insertion of which vitally
affects our present vested rights.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. If it could be worked out along the lines
suggested, you would not object to that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. No, sir; no, sir. But, in my opinion, you will
never be able to draw a better or more workable line of demarkation
between the inventor and composer than that now set up by the
Constitution, particularly if you follow the lines of the present bill
as regards mechanical devices, in respect to which collusive elements
have been at work behind the drafting of the bill. I will give you my
word of honor to produce evidence of it.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Of what character?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. That Mr. Sousa, or rather the majority of
composers, have been sold out by their publishers to this monopolistic
octopus, the Æolian Co. and lesser satellites, and that contracts exist
which anticipate and control benefits designed primarily for the
composers, with whom us inventors have no direct fight.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. The idea is now, you know, to try to protect these
people who produce the music to the public, and all that. They have
rights which we are bound to respect, as well as the inventor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; and I would help you in all reasonable
and lawful efforts.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. And the idea now is to try to evolve something
that will treat everybody fairly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir. But if the Constitution has led inventors
on, given an incentive to them to go ahead and work and devote their
funds and lives to developing these industries, which are second to
none in the world as young industries, it would be wrong to come in at
this stage and either curtail the incentive or subtract from rights
already vested in them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Yes; but that very clause gives the same
incentive and protection to the musical author, does it not, as to the
inventor? He is protected on his writings as you are on your discovery?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; there is a line of demarcation set up in
the Constitution. I went in to try to get the line of demarcation
between an inventor and a composer. I went in, as I thought,
intelligently. I have studied the laws right down to the last decision
of the 25th ultimo, that of the court of appeal for the second circuit,
and all confirm the contention which I have made here that the only
incentive held up to the composer is a specific protection for his
"writings," not on machines.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Would you object to Mr. Sousa taking your
invention and combining it with his composition and putting it upon the
market?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. If there was some fair, equitable way of doing
that, no sir, I would not. But unfortunately, we inventors and
composers are the ones that are generally imposed on, and naturally I
am fearful that any change in the laws as they now exist will prove
disadvantageous to both our interests.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. If I understand your position correctly, you feel
that Mr. Sousa has no more right to require any further compensation
from a phonograph company, if it be a phonograph company, for the use
of any particular piece of music which has been copyrighted, and of
which he has received the benefit, than an inventor of a drum would
have a right, after he has been protected by a patent right, to require
Mr. Sousa to pay further for the use of that right. That is your
position, is it not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Well, you can look at that in two different lights.
From the legal standpoint he has no right whatever. From an ethical
standpoint there seems to be a sort of remote ethical right. I am not a
lawyer, and not used to legal verbiage, and am not sure that I can
clearly differentiate between legal and ethical rights.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Well, this is the "Constitution between friends,"
you know.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. As inventors we proceeded under the laws of the
land as they exist.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. That is just what I say.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Mr. Sousa, through his publishers, has tried in the
various courts to have the word "writing" broadened, but he has failed
to do so, and he now comes to you to do it. In no copyright act or law
has there ever been introduced before&mdash;you will not find it
anywhere&mdash;one word or clause or phrase, before this one, that covers
mechanical devices.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Under that word "writing" you want to exclude such
people as Mr. Sousa entirely from its operation in respect to
self-playing musical instruments?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. If you are going to work under the Constitution;
yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Then, is it not high time that we were giving it a
little wider construction than that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. I think it is rather late in the day, after we
inventors have spent our lives at this art and created a new industry.
I think you ought to have done it soon after 1789, if at all, and if
the law had been passed then there is no inventor in the land that
would have gone ahead developing this particular art.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Why not, Mr. Davis?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Because we would have been dominated by composers,
as I have explained at great length.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Mr. Sousa can not use your machine nor your
process.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. But we would have gone into other fields or arts
not dominated by composers. We would have left this art undeveloped. He
may make use of machines if he can construct them with "writings" or
musical tones and infringe only a remote correlative ethical right of
the inventors.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Well, now if there is a mercantile demand, a
commercial demand, for your method of reproducing music, why would you
not have gone into it for exactly the same reason? If Mr. Sousa's
music, played upon your machine, meets a public demand, he must use
your instrument just exactly the same as you use his music.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. But suppose there are half a dozen of these
concerns and one of them, by an arrangement with the musical publishers
of the country, gets control of all the copyrights?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. That is what they have done, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Then would the competing concerns be able to use
their instruments at all?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. They might use, but could not sell, and over their
pecuniary misery would weep alone. [Applause.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. The proposition here is that this bill, as I
understand it, does not affect what has already been done. It applies
to the future. You all stand upon the same level, and that relates
right back to the contractual rights of the parties. If Mr. Sousa
desires to make a contract with some machine producing music
independent from yours, why should his right to do so be restricted by
us under the law? That is the question I would like to have you answer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Well, sir, I am not a lawyer&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. No; but that is a practical question.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. I have been trying to get counsel here. He would
probably have advised me in my opening speech for the opposition to
imitate Mr. Sousa in making a bid for your sympathy and avoid a
discussion of fine legal points, but I will give you my practical ideas
of that. I am an inventor who has studied the law, but without being a
lawyer I am ready to say that as the law now stands&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. I am speaking of the future. This bill affects
the future.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Well, "this bill affects the future," but has it
the right to affect the future? Has it the right to change a situation
which has existed since 1789? The bill proposes a change, not merely
amend the Constitution, therefore I challenge the authority of Congress
to enact it. At present the composer has no contractual right as
regards a machine, and Congress can not give it to him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. That is the very proposition we are trying to
get at.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We can not very well change the Constitution.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. It is not a question of changing the Constitution;
it is a question of giving the Constitution its fullest scope.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Well, a gentleman speaking here yesterday, Mr.
Stephen H. Olin, counsel for the American Publishers' Copyright League,
although favoring this bill as a whole, gave you a warning that if this
bill attempted to broaden the word "writing" so as to include a
machine, then the bill in this respect might be held by the Supreme
Court to be unconstitutional, and I have already traced the
introduction of the terms "machine" or "device" in the bill direct to
the monopolistic octopus. Mr. Olin made that statement here yesterday
voluntarily.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I know that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Proceeding further, Mr. Olin said he was not
interested in the introduction of any clause restricting the mechanical
reproduction of music; that he was satisfied to leave that to the
courts, and let the courts give the construction of that word "writing"
in the Constitution. They have been at work at it for many years, with
the result that a machine remains a machine and not a "writing."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Mr. Davis, your idea is that if the composer or
publisher copyrights a piece of music and sells it and in the sale gets
whatever price his copyright or royalty gives him, and you buy it, or
anybody else buys it, that that purchaser has a right to play it or
sing it in public or private, or anywhere else he pleases?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. No, sir; I do not say that, exactly, sir&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. What is your position, then, if that is not your
position?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Your proposition brings up the question of public
performance. I say that the composer's rights are limited under
existing laws to all benefits which he may receive from his visible,
readable "writings" expressing his original musical conceptions, and
that he can make copies of it in any manner he sees fit; but he has not
the right to usurp the rights of an inventor to reproduce that music
through self-acting mechanical means in public or private. The inventor
has a peculiar field here. The Constitution, as I would translate it,
in layman's language, says: "Now, Mr. Inventor, if you can come in and
invent a machine in which the melodies that would otherwise be lost can
be forever preserved and reproduced to the public for the public
benefit, you shall be protected." This includes public performances. We
do this in a way that does not decrease Mr. Sousa's income, but
increases it, as I have explained.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. If a man goes to a store and buys a piece of
copyrighted music he expects to have the right to sing it and play it
anywhere he pleases; otherwise, what does he want to buy it for?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. That is the human agency. Mr. Sousa's compensation
may or may not cover all human agencies for reproducing that music,
including public performances, and concerning which the inventor is not
specially interested. The inventor should have the right to all
mechanical agencies, where the human agency does not enter into it in
any way whatever, including public performance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Well, they say you can use your mechanical devices
wherever you please, just so you do not use their music.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Well, Mr. Sousa is not construing the laws. I am
telling you my idea of the laws, as I understood them when I entered
into this art ten years ago, and as the courts have sustained them
right up to a few days ago.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Mr. Davis, as I understand you, you would not
object at all to paying a royalty for any music that you may use upon
any instrument that you may have invented or produced, providing that
that same royalty is paid by all other concerns or individuals, and
that all other concerns and individuals may have the same right to use
it as any particular one that the producer of the music may even try to
designate himself?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Individually&mdash;and I believe I represent the class
of inventors affected by the proposed act&mdash;and without retreating from
the stand I have taken regarding our present rights, I would not
object, because I recognize that remote ethical right which you are
casting about to secure and deliver over to the composer together with
the many other new gifts in the bill. If you can protect it in some
such way as will meet my many objections, we inventors will be
satisfied, but I am constrained to say that I think your efforts will
be futile.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. I think that is all, Mr. Davis. You can submit
in writing any further statement that you desire to make.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Thank you; and may I submit later the evidences and
proofs to which I have referred?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You may do that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Senators and Representatives in joint committee
assembled, I thank you for the close attention which you have given to
my remarks and for the liberal extension of time within which to make
them; and on behalf of the inventors of this country I assure you of
our full confidence and belief that you will finally modify the
proposed act in a way that will protect our properties and persons
against the monopolistic giants who do now or may hereafter seek to
destroy us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman referred to "visible
music." Now, as I think you can see, that [referring to sheet music] is
music, one notation. This [indicating perforated roll] is a perforated
roll. That is visible; that is music in another notation. That is what
they are taking [indicating perforated roll]; that [indicating sheet
music] is what we are paid for.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Mr. Chairman, one word. Mr. Davis has made a
statement which is absolutely untrue. He said, speaking about the
Æolian Company and this contract which they have signed, or made the
publishers sign with them, that "They control the publishers and the
publishers control the composers." That is absolutely untrue in my
case. Nobody controls my works, the works that I am going to write. I
am going to bring out a work in September, of which I have only written
a few notes so far. I do not even know what I am going to write, and
nobody has a contract with me to-day. I want to state most emphatically
that I have not even been approached by any firm for the future.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Who is your publisher?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Mr. Whitmark, of New York.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Has anybody else published any of your music?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Yes; Schubert &amp; Co., Schirmer &amp; Co., and so on.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Do you mean lately?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. That was before I went with Whitmark.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. How long have you been with him?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. About six or seven years.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. And nobody else has published any of your music
in six or seven years?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Not since then; no, sir. Naturally, I have a
perfect right to go around to my friends and get the best offer I can,
have I not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Surely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. There must be competition. But I want to state
most emphatically&mdash;and I know that these gentlemen are going to try to
make the point that arrangements have already been made&mdash;that there
have no arrangements been made in my case&mdash;absolutely none. I have not
even been approached by any one of the companies&mdash;not even by the
company, for instance, that is in favor of paying the royalty, the
Victor Talking Machine Company. They have never spoken a word to me
about the future, and I have not made a contract for my next work with
Whitmark &amp; Sons yet. I may publish it with somebody else; I do not
know. So I am perfectly free to say that his statement in that respect
was absolutely untrue.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I would like to say, Mr. Chairman, that I have
never been approached by any of the mechanical instrument companies;
and the house which I have a contract with, the publishing house, is
not a member of the Music Publishers' Association. I have never even
been approached by any of them, and I have no contract with anyone.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We will hear you now, Mr. O'Connell.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman, for the group of interests which are
now to be heard I wish to make a statement that they might feel called
upon or required to make, but which it is not fair should be taken out
of their time. They were not participants in the conferences. How
completely they were omitted is apparent only from the list. That list
is before you. It will take but a moment to read the titles of these
associations: American Authors' Copyright League, National
Institute&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. We know them.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. They are already in the record. They have been
laid before us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. They were not participants in the conferences.
They were not invited to the conferences by the copyright office. There
were no notices sent to them from the copyright office that the
conferences were being held; that these provisions were being
considered at them. The copyright office shows, so far as I am aware,
no communication with them on the subject of any of these provisions.
We have never, ourselves, in any way notified them that these
provisions were being proposed for the bill. I say that as much because
it is to their advantage that I should say it as for them to say it,
and it is not fair that that statement should have to be made at the
expense of their time.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF JOHN J. O'CONNELL.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. We intended to make that statement ourselves.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Whom do you represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I appear on behalf of ten independent
manufacturers of automatic piano players in the city of New York, and
the names of these concerns are as follows: Winter &amp; Co., Ludwig &amp; Co.,
Jacob Doll &amp; Sons, Laffargue &amp; Co., John Ludwig, the Regal Piano and
Player Company, Ricca &amp; Son, the Auto-Electric Piano Company, Newby &amp;
Evans, and the Estey Piano Company.
</p>

<p>
I also appear on behalf, by arrangement here, of independent
manufacturers of music rolls. I can also say that possibly what I shall
have to say to your committee will represent the ideas of the various
independent manufacturers of automatic piano players in the United
States and the various independent manufacturers of perforated music
rolls.
</p>

<p>
To anybody reading the provisions of this bill it would appear very
clearly that one of the great special interests were the manufacturers
of perforated music rolls. Proceed a little further and it will be very
apparent that the manufacturers of automatic piano-playing instruments,
which can not be operated without music rolls, had a very special
interest in this bill. It would be the easiest thing in creation to
notify the manufacturers of music rolls and the manufacturers of
automatic piano players of these conferences. Take up any directory of
manufacturers in the United States and you would find them by the
dozen.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Let me interrupt you for a moment, Mr.
O'Connell, to say that so far as I myself am concerned it does not seem
necessary to continue longer upon that line, for the reason that the
committees of the Senate and House are now giving you a hearing, and
you shall have an ample opportunity to present your side of the case.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I simply wanted to make it clear to the whole
committee, as I explained it to the chairman yesterday, that it was
only last Saturday that we knew what the situation was and knew what
the provisions of this bill were.
</p>

<p>
I might say at the outset that the companies which I represent are not
members of that class which Mr. Putnam so delicately denominated as
pirates. We are here to protect industries in which there are invested
millions of dollars. It has also been said by some of these special
interests which are appearing in favor of the bill, in elegant
language, that we were "butters-in" at the eleventh hour, and that we
are here for the purpose of a hold-up. If protecting our business makes
us butters-in and hold-up artists, then we come under that definition.
</p>

<p>
I want to say furthermore, at the outset, that we have no particular
controversy or quarrel with those very eminent gentlemen, Mr. Herbert
and Mr. Sousa. It is perfectly proper for them to seek to get all they
possibly can from the products of their genius, but we are all a great
deal too sentimentally inclined toward them and their possessions
because of the many hours of delight they have given to every one of
us.
</p>

<p>
Here is our position, and I will try to outline it as briefly as I
possibly can: A number of years ago in the city of New York, within the
last decade, a number of gentlemen interested in a manufacturing
concern, one of the pioneers in the piano-playing industry, had the
foresight to realize that the industry was destined to become one in
which there were millions of dollars of profit, followed the conclusion
that they would like to get for themselves all of the millions in that
particular industry. The question was how to achieve and attain that
result. Naturally they turned to the patent laws, to get monopolies
under patents covering not only the machines themselves, but also the
music rolls, without which the machines could not be operated, and
machinery for cutting such music rolls.
</p>

<p>
Applications were made on their behalf for hundreds of patents, both on
the machine and on the music rolls, and on machines for cutting the
music rolls. Before they had gone very far, however, it developed that
the patent laws would not afford them a monopoly of the machines or the
music rolls, because of the fact that they could not get and control a
basic patent, for the reasons that in the first place the operation by
means of wind instruments, vacuums, etc., of an automatic playing
device was as old as pipe organs, and furthermore that the perforated
music roll or perforated music sheet was also as old as the very
ancient hand organ. Therefore they saw that it was utterly impossible
for them to obtain the monopoly which they wanted under the patent
laws, and naturally the next thing for them to consider was: Can we not
attain the required result through the copyright laws?
</p>

<p>
Eminent counsel were retained, and those eminent counsel, after an
examination of the existing copyright laws and decisions, made this
discovery: That in what is known as the McTammany case, decided by
Judge Colt in the United States circuit court for the district of
Massachusetts some twenty years ago, that jurist held that the
perforated music sheet used in a hand organ was not an infringement of
the copyright music sheet covered by the statute. When they had reached
this point it became necessary to develop a new line of action, and
this was the new line of action:
</p>

<p>
Now, there existed at that time an association of music publishers, and
that association included and includes practically all of the big
publishing houses which turn out the classical as well as the modern
and popular compositions of the day. They said to themselves: Let us
make contracts with all of these houses whereby we will get from these
houses the exclusive right to reproduce the compositions which they
handle in music rolls and other mechanical devices. Then we will go
ahead and we will institute suits and try to obtain a reversal of the
decision of Judge Colt in the McTammany case, and if we fail in that,
then, holding exclusive contracts as we do with the vast majority of
the publishing houses, we will go before the Congress and get from it
what the courts refused us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I am not speaking in the air about this. I
have here with me a copy of two contracts made with one house in
Chicago by this monopoly, and I now offer in evidence those two
contracts.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. What is this monopoly? You have not mentioned the
name of it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. The Æolian Company, of New York, which is a
Connecticut corporation.

<p>
Memorandum of agreement, made and entered into this 30th day of April,
1902, by and between Clayton F. Summy Company, of Chicago, in the State
of Illinois, party of the first part, hereinafter called the publisher,
and the Æolian Company, a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of Connecticut, and having a place of business in the city of
New York in the State of New York, party of the second part,
hereinafter called the Æolian Company, witnesseth: </p>

<p> That whereas, the publisher is the proprietor of certain copyrights
for musical compositions and the owner of rights in copyrights for
other musical compositions; and </p>

<p> Whereas, the Æolian Company is engaged in the business of
manufacturing and selling automatic musical instruments controlled by
perforated music sheets, and in manufacturing and selling machines for
playing keyboard musical instruments, which machines are controlled by
perforated music sheets, and in manufacturing and selling perforated
music sheets for such automatic musical instruments and machines; and
</p>

<p> Whereas, the Æolian Company is desirous of acquiring the
exclusive right for such perforated music sheets in and to all the
copyrighted musical compositions of which the publisher is the
proprietor, or as to which he is the owner of any rights, and of all
those other musical compositions which may hereafter be protected by
copyright, and the copyrights for which or rights in which may be
acquired by him; </p>

<p> Now, therefore, the publisher, for and in consideration of the
premises, and of the sum of $1, lawful money of the United States, to
him paid by the Æolian Company, receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, and for and in consideration of the true and faithful
performance by the Æolian Company of its covenants hereinafter
made, does hereby sell, assign, transfer, and set over unto the
Æolian Company, the exclusive right for all perforated music
sheets of the kinds aforesaid in and to all the copyrighted musical
compositions of which the publisher is the proprietor, or in the case
in which he is the owner of any less rights, to the extent of said
rights, and does hereby covenant and agree with the Æolian
Company to give and secure to it, the exclusive right in like manner
for all perforated music sheets of the kinds aforesaid in and to all
those other musical compositions which may hereafter be protected by
copyright, and the copyrights or rights in which may be acquired by the
publisher. </p>

<p> And the publisher for the consideration aforesaid hereby covenants
and agrees, so far as it may be reasonably in his power, to protect the
Æolian Company against any claim of any third person in respect
to any and all copyrighted musical compositions which may be involved
in this agreement, and the copyright of which may be owned by the
publisher. </p>

<p> And the Æolian Company for and in consideration of the
premises hereby agrees that it will keep correct and true books of
account in which it will set down or cause to be set down entries of
all perforated music sheets made by it for playing the copyrighted
musical compositions owned or controlled by the publisher; that it will
on the 20th day of each and every January and July, during the
continuance of the manufacture and sale by it of the perforated music
sheets for playing such musical compositions, render unto the publisher
a correct and true statement of the number, names, and other
designations of such perforated music sheets sold by it during the six
preceding calendar months, and that at the time of rendering each and
every such statement it will well and truly pay unto the publisher a
license fee or royalty of 10 per cent of the list prices made by the
United States publishers of the printed scores or copies of such
musical compositions, but never more than 50 cents for any one of such
perforated music sheets. </p>

<p> And the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree that nothing
herein contained is to obligate the Æolian Company to pay any
license fee or royalty upon such perforated music sheets as shall be
made by it in the United States and sold or shipped to any other
country, unless it shall have been decided by a court of competent
jurisdiction of such other country that the copyright laws of that
country shall be applicable to perforated music sheets of the kind
herein mentioned. </p>

<p> And the parties hereto mutually agree and covenant that the term
"perforated music sheets" is not to be construed as covering the
controllers of those musical instruments which are generally known as
phonographs, or music boxes, or hand organs. </p>

<p> Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding at the expiration
of thirty-five years from the payment of the first license fee
hereinbefore provided, the Æolian Company shall not be entitled
to license under the copyrights thereafter acquired by the publisher,
but all licenses existing under copyrights theretofore acquired by him
shall remain in force until the expiration of the terms of the
copyrights under the terms hereinbefore provided. </p>

<p> During the existence of this contract, after the payment of the
license fee hereunder, the Æolian Company obligates itself to
prosecute diligently, at its own expense and by its own counsel, in the
name of the proprietors of the copyright, all infringers of the rights
granted to it, the Æolian Company. </p>

<p> And the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree that all
provisions of this agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the
successors, executors, administrators and personal representatives of
both the parties hereto. </p>

Memorandum of agreement, made and entered into this 30th day of April,

of Illinois, party of the first part, hereinafter called the publisher,
and the Æolian Company, a corporation organized under the laws of

New York, in the State of New York, party of the second part,
hereinafter called the Æolian Company, witnesseth </p>

<p> That whereas the parties hereto have, of even date herewith,
entered into an agreement whereby the Æolian Company is to have
the exclusive right for all perforated music sheets intended for use in
controlling-automatic musical instruments or machines for playing
musical instruments, in and to the copyrighted musical compositions of
which the publisher is the proprietor or as to which he is the owner of
any rights, and in and to all those other musical compositions which
may hereafter be protected by copyright and the copyrights or rights in
which may be acquired by him; and </p>

<p> Whereas the parties hereto are desirous of entering into a further
agreement with reference to the matters and things expressed in the
above-mentioned agreement of even date herewith; </p>

<p> Now, therefore, the publisher, for and in consideration of the
premises and the sum of $1 lawful money of the United States, to him by
the Æolian Company in hand paid, receipt whereof is hereby

is to be instituted against some manufacturer or user, other than the
Æolian Company, of such perforated music sheets, for the purpose
of testing the applicability of the United States copyright laws to
such perforated music sheets, and not then unless such decision shall
uphold the applicability of the United States copyright laws to
perforated music sheets of the kinds aforesaid. </p>

<p> And for and in consideration of the premises the Æolian
Company hereby covenants and agrees to pay all proper expenses of
conducting said suit for the purpose of testing the applicability of
the United States copyright laws to perforated music sheets of the

decide that the United States copyright laws are applicable to such
perforated music sheets, then and in such case and from that time
forward the Æolian Company will keep books of account, render
statements, and pay royalties as provided by the aforesaid agreement of

<p> And it is mutually understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
neither party hereto is to be obligated in any way by any other

Both of those contracts are dated April 30, 1902. After the making of
those contracts, the action known as the White-Smith suit against the
Apollo Company was commenced in the circuit court of the United States
for the southern district of New York. That case went to a hearing
before Judge Hazel. Right at this point I may interpolate that I now
ask the chairman and the members of this committee to investigate, if
they feel they have the power, into those contracts, to summon
witnesses, if necessary, to determine what contracts have been made,
with what music-publishing houses, by this particular concern, so that
the committees may be able to determine for themselves whether this
concern and the publishing houses with which they are affiliated can,
in the event that this bill becomes a law, have an absolute monopoly of
the vast majority of the publications, in so far as they may be
reproduced into perforated music rolls or other mechanical devices for
reproducing the sounds.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I want to ask you the question that I asked Mr.
Davis a moment ago: Would the people whom you represent object to
paying a reasonable royalty to the author or proprietor of the musical
composition if that right was given to all upon the same terms?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Primarily, I appear, sir, for the independent
manufacturers of automatic piano players. Here, to-day, as I
understand, I am expected to speak for the interests of the independent
cutters of music rolls as well. Speaking for the clients that I
originally and personally represent, I answer that provided you have
the power to pass such a law we have no objection to paying a
reasonable royalty to the composers, provided we are put on an equal
basis with everybody else and provided our business interests are
protected. That is our attitude. We do not wish to be unfair to
anybody.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Protection in what way? How far do you wish that
protection to extend?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. In this way: It is difficult to devise a
plan&mdash;in answer to the question of Mr. Currier&mdash;which will protect us,
and for this reason&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I realize the difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. You have no idea of being protected any more
than any other concern?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. No, sir; we want to have only the same rights
as anybody else.
</p>

<p>
You must understand, Mr. Chairman, that the Æolian Company is by far
the largest manufacturer of automatic piano players. If they control
the output of the device, without which those players can not be
operated, it is perfectly clear that it is the easiest thing on earth
for them to put one after the other of the independent manufacturers
down and out. I have not thought up a plan which could be devised to
protect them, because that is a very difficult thing to do, and the
time given for preparation has been extremely brief.
</p>

<p>
In line with what Mr. Herbert said a few moments ago, we are perfectly
clear that neither Mr. Herbert nor Mr. Sousa can be controlled by this
combination. They are too big. But they are the only composers in the
United States to-day of whom that can be said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. How about De Koven, and how about Julian Edwards;
and how about&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. That being so, it seems strange to me that
those eminently respectable gentlemen, Mr. Herbert and Mr. Sousa, have
been put forward here as advocates of this bill, when the very men who
will be the greatest gainers by it have sedulously kept themselves in
the background, and do not appear to be represented here, even
nominally.
</p>

<p>
What will be the result if these features of the bill are put through?
Mr. Herbert and Mr. Sousa will get some benefits from it. Ninety-nine
per cent of the composers will get absolutely nothing from it. The
Æolian Company and the concerns affiliated with it will have millions
of dollars turned into their coffers. And the net result is that the
public will pay and the independent manufacturers whom we represent
will either go out of business, or will have to transact business in
such a way that it will be without any profit to themselves, or
entirely on sufferance. That is the broad, general question that is
before you, gentlemen, of these committees. We only want a square deal.
We want no rights that anybody else does not get.
</p>

<p>
But we do not want to have others put in a position where they can take
away our right to do business on a reasonable basis. That being the
broad general proposition, I shall expect during the summer vacation to
supply your committees with as much information as I possibly can on
these various matters, and I ask the committees to do what they can
toward investigating how far I am right in this matter. I can say that
those charges have been made in the White-Smith suits in the circuit
court and circuit court of appeals, and they have not been answered in
anyway by the representatives of the monopoly to which I refer, nor
have they been denied.
</p>

<p>
On the bill itself&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. What section?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I will take it from the beginning, if you
please.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Before you proceed with the bill: Have the
companies that you represent made any effort to secure contracts with
Mr. Sousa and Mr. Herbert and the other composers that have been
mentioned?
</p>

<p>
M. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. The companies that I represent do not make
contracts with composers. The companies that I represent primarily, the
10 manufacturers, do not cut perforated music. They buy it. They buy it
either from the Æolian Company, or from one of the many independent
manufacturers of such rolls. So that we are not brought into direct
contact with Mr. Sousa, Mr. Herbert, or any composers. We want to be in
a position where the independents will not be forced out of the field,
or where we can be forced to buy this perforated music at an exorbitant
figure, or where they can be in the position of refusing to give it to
us at any price.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. These companies, as I understand, under existing
law simply go to the store offering the music for sale, which is music,
and then put it upon the rolls. Is that right?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I do not know what the particular arrangements
are that the composers have with the publishers, or the publishers with
the music companies.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Under existing law, is it necessary for the
manufacturer to do more than I have stated?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Under the existing law, as it has been decided
in the White-Smith suit, the cutter of music rolls can go anywhere and
take a piece of music, copyrighted or uncopyrighted, and cut the roll
from it. That is my understanding of it, without paying any royalty to
anybody.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. And the gentlemen and concerns you represent
desire the law to remain in that condition?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I have not said that, sir. What we say is this:
We want to be able to go out in the open market and buy our music
rolls. We will not be in that position if this bill goes through,
because with these contracts that I speak of we can not go into the
open market, as there will be no open market whatever. The distribution
of these music rolls will be in the hands of one house, and that house
can put its own price on them, or refuse to sell them to us at all at
any price. In other words, in passing this bill in its present shape,
you are fostering too great a centralization of power, or putting an
absolute monopoly into the hands of one group of men. That is our
objection. If some means can be devised whereby we get in on the same
basis, whereby we can buy our records or our perforated music sheets as
Mr. Currier said, on the same terms as anybody else, we have no fault
to find, then.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. How can law prevent Mr. Sousa from making a
contract with the Æolian people or any other concern that he may desire
to deal with?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. The law can not prevent him from making any
contracts he chooses with them, provided he does not contravene the law
of the land itself. He can make any contract he chooses for any price
he chooses. But there is the unfortunate situation: Mr. Sousa and Mr.
Herbert, and gentlemen situated as they are, naturally ought to be in a
position, I suppose, where they have liberty of contract; but in
passing a law the greatest good to the greatest number must always be
considered. If you pass this bill you do some good to these gentlemen,
you do a great deal of good to the monopoly, you do absolutely no good
to the vast majority of the authors, and you do a great deal of damage
to a great many millions of dollars interested and invested in
manufacturing industries in this country, even if you leave the
purchasing public out of consideration altogether. It is a question of
which you will take, unless some means can be devised to eliminate
those particular features.
</p>

<p>
Taking the bill itself, it was stated here by Mr. Putnam the other day
that the object of this bill was to give a copyright on music rolls as
to musical compositions composed after the passage of this act. That
was my understanding of what he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Copyrighted afterwards, I think I said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Then I assumed, from the remarks made by some
members of the committee, that they considered the act to apply only to
compositions originally composed after the passage of this act, and
originally copyrighted after the passage of this act. I do not believe,
therefore, that the members of the committee are aware of the very many
peculiar features of the bill in that regard.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. The bill is only submitted as a tentative
proposition, to get at the right thing. It is not the result of our
genius at all. It belongs to some of the rest of you fellows.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. It does not belong, Mr. Chaney, to me or the
rest of my fellows; and we are here trying to oppose the genius of the
other men, the specially interested ones who did submit it to your
committee. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Well, we fellows are not trying to shut out you
fellows.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I know that you are not, and all we want is a
fair, full, and complete hearing.
</p>

<p>
Taking first, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committees, subdivision
F of the first paragraph. There is still a subdivision B in that
subdivision F:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
To make any arrangement or setting of such work, or of the melody
thereof, In any system of notation.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. On page 2?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I am reading from the House bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. We have the Senate bill here. What is the section?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Section 1, subdivision F.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. It is on page 2.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. It gives the right&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
to make any arrangement or setting of such work, or of the melody
thereof, in any system of notation.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Then it goes on (subdivision G):
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
To make, sell, distribute or let for hire any device, contrivance,
or appliance especially adapted in any manner whatsoever to
reproduce to the ear the whole or any material part of the work
published and copyrighted after this act shall have gone into
effect, or by means of any such device or appliance publicly to
reproduce to the ear the whole or any material part of such work.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Before you leave that, do you not think that section
G prohibits the sale of the instrument itself, rather than the
reproduction of the music or the work? You are a lawyer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. It would seem that it prohibits both, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. We will submit an amendment to cover that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. It seems that that is a prohibition of the sale of
any instrument.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Clearly so.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I have not seen the proposed amendment, because
it was only handed in this morning after we got here.
</p>

<p>
Turning to section 6, it says&mdash;and this is very important:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That additions to copyrighted works and alterations, revisions,
abridgments, dramatizations, translations, compilations,
arrangements, or other versions of works, whether copyrighted or in
the public domain, shall be regarded as new works, subject to
copyright under the provisions of this act.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, if you please, turn to section 18, subdivision B. It gives a
copyright for fifty years after the first publication, and you will
find at line 13 of the House bill, which I hold, that it gives a
copyright for fifty years after the date of the first publication, in
"any arrangement or reproduction in some new form of a musical
composition." Then, you will find further down, in subsection C of that
section 18, where it gives a copyright for the lifetime of the author
and for fifty years afterwards in the case of an original musical
composition, thus making it clear, from a reading of all those sections
together, that first, where there is an original composition, say of
Mr. Sousa or Mr. Herbert, which has been already copyrighted under the
present act, under the provisions of this new act they have the right
to prohibit the cutting of music rolls for the period of fifty years
from those original compositions which they have already copyrighted;
and, secondly, the most dangerous provision of the bill, that any
music-cutting establishment&mdash;this monopoly, for instance&mdash;can take any
old work, that has never been cut to this day into a music roll, which
is in the public domain&mdash;one of Beethoven's sonatas, or the Star
Spangled Banner, if that has not already been done&mdash;and they can cut a
music roll and can copyright that, and they can get the exclusive right
because of such cutting, notwithstanding that everybody is free to
perform that particular piece in every other way. This bill gives the
right to cut it into a music roll and get a copyright for fifty years
after the first publication in the form of a perforated music sheet.
That, I submit, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, is a very iniquitous
provision&mdash;very iniquitous.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That starts in on page 4 and concludes on page 14?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I think you are right about that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Thank you for agreeing with me.
</p>

<p>
Then, there is another provision of section 19, which was covered
yesterday by Mr. Ogilvie, in regard to book publishing, to which I have
the same objection, and that is that where the author dies his family
can not get the continued copyright for fifty years unless the assignee
or licensee shall join in the application for such renewal and
extension. Some provision ought to be made there so that in case the
licensee or assignee refuses, at the instance of the widow or orphans
of the author, to apply for an extension of the contract, the widow and
orphans shall have the right to proceed independently of the assignee
or licensee. As Mr. Ogilvie very well said, where the publisher has the
right to reproduce on the payment of a royalty of 20 per cent he may
very well say now, after the author dies, "I will not apply with you
for this extension unless you permit me to pay you merely a royalty of
2 per cent."
</p>

<p>
I simply point that out as one of the injustices of the act, as showing
that only special interests apparently seem to have been considered in
the framing of the bill.
</p>

<p>
There is another question there, which will probably be covered by Mr.
Walker in what he has to say to the committee afterwards, and that is
as to the constitutionality of these provisions as a whole. I will
merely point out what the Constitution provides in that respect.
</p>

<p>
Article 1, section 8, subdivision 8, gives the right to Congress&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing
for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive rights to
their respective writings and discoveries.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It has been held, in the case of the Lithograph Company v. Sarony, 111
U.S., 53, at page 58, that the only thing which appears to infringe
upon copyrighted matter would be&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
some visible form of writing, printing, engraving, etching, by
which the ideas in the mind of the author are given visible
expression.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. Sousa pointed out the ordinary system of notation with the various
notes, and he also held up to you a music roll with the perforations,
slits, dots, and dashes, and he claimed, apparently, that those slits,
dots, and dashes are visible and can be read. I doubt very much if Mr.
Sousa can tell one note from another there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I could tell the notes on that sheet just as well
as I could on the other. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. All I have to say then is that apparently music
is not one of your many accomplishments. [Laughter.] Some of us can not
read Sanskrit, nor Hebrew, nor Greek, perhaps, but that does not mean
that we can not read at all, nor that such languages can not be read.
There are many of us that do understand the ordinary diatonic notation
of music, and many of us that do not. The fact that the vast majority
of people can not read music does not prevent it from being a writing.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do you contend that it is beyond the power of
Congress to make that roll copyrightable?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. My contention is, sir, that it is absolutely
beyond the power of Congress to make that roll copyrightable.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Are there people that can read that roll&mdash;that
is, the same as Mr. Sousa can pick up that piece of music there
[indicating] and read that music? In other words, every slit or cut or
dash in that paper represents a note, does it not, just the same as the
notes are differently represented upon the paper that Mr. Sousa
exhibited&mdash;or a musical tone is represented?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. It may be, but I do not think that there is a
person, firm, or corporation in the United States or elsewhere to-day
that can take that music roll and tell you what particular note any
particular slit or dot or dash represents. If I am wrong, I want to be
corrected.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. It is a notation of tone, then?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. It is simply by relation to what is called the
tracker board. This roll goes over a tracker board in which there are
little holes. Each hole in the tracker board is connected with a little
tube which carries the air through a bellows and to a device which
strikes a hammer. As this roll goes over the tracker board of the
instrument, when it strikes a hole corresponding to any particular one
of those slits there is an ingress of air, because there is a vacuum
underneath. That little tube is connected with a hammer which strikes
the note A, B, C, and so forth, whatever it might be. They are
differently arranged in different rolls. The roll that will play in one
instrument will not play in another; and you can see, gentlemen, that
there is a different-sized roll, different-sized slits [exhibiting
sample rolls] notwithstanding that they are both the same piece of
music, composed by Mr. Sousa. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. In looking at those two rolls, there is no
question but what anybody can tell that they are the same piece of
music.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. But look at the difference across&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. That is only as to the size. You can take that
same sheet of music that Mr. Sousa exhibited and have it four inches
wide or you can have it eight inches wide, and it would be just the
same music.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. But can anybody tell me, if you please, sir, or
will anybody tell us, what those notes are?
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. That is the question that I asked you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bowker</span>. I can, by taking a scale corresponding to that
instrument and putting it on the paper. By doing that you can tell what
the note is.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I was counsel in the Apollo case, and the question
whether those rolls could be read by inspection was litigated at great
expense in that case, and the circuit court of appeals for the second
circuit decided, a week ago last Friday, that the overwhelming
preponderance of the evidence was that they could not be read.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. And further, that that is not a copy of the music
from which it is taken.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. They so decided. Judge Colt decided in 1888 that
these perforated rolls are not copies of music filed in the office of
the Librarian of Congress. That decision was always acquiesced in until
the Æolian Company invented its ingenious scheme to monopolize the
business of mechanical musical instruments; and in pursuance of that
event they endeavored to secure from the circuit court of appeals in
the southern district of New York a reversal of Judge Colt's decision.
After years of litigation the circuit court of appeals for the second
circuit affirmed Judge Colt's decision, and held that these do not
infringe the copyright on the sheet music, and, as the foundation for
that holding, they stated the overwhelming preponderance of evidence
was that they could not be read by anybody; and they stated for that
reason that they were not copies, and were not infringements.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I have been informed, while Mr. Walker was
speaking, in response to what Mr. Bowker said, that in this White-Smith
suit the complainants tried in every possible way to prove the truth of
the assertion which Mr. Bowker has just made, and that they utterly and
totally failed to sustain that assertion that those sheets could be
read, even with the use of any kind of a scale. That has just been
stated to me by a gentleman who is interested.
</p>

<p>
If you please, Mr. Chairman, the portion of the decision relating to
that particular point has been handed to me, and here it is&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. We have that decision.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I want to call attention briefly to just this
point in it:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
It is not designed to be read or actually used in reading music as
the original staff notation is; and the claim that it may be read,
which is practically disproved by the great preponderance of
evidence, even if it were true, would establish merely a theory of
possibility of use as distinguished from an actual use.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In deciding those cases, courts and committees of Congress do not act
on possibilities.
</p>

<p>
Here is another method of reproduction [exhibiting disk] of the same
march of Mr. Sousa's. It is for use in a music box. I do not know what
the name of the music box is. The disk was only handed to me this
morning. That shows another method of reproducing, and I do not suppose
that even Mr. Bowker, with the aid of a scale, can read the notes on
it. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Again, there is still another one here [exhibiting cylinder], which has
been handed to me by Mr. Walker, a phonograph record, which he
unfortunately says he broke, and which contains the same march by Mr.
Sousa. And I do not believe that even Mr. Bowker, with the aid of any
kind of a scale, can read that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bowker</span>. My name has been mentioned, and may I say that the
character of the phonograph record which uses the very word "graph,"
meaning "writing," represents the earliest form of writing, that of
incised character writing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Of the time of Rameses.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. May I state that it remained for the inventor to
first devise that scale to which that perforated music was made, and,
second, to devise a machine which would interpret that music to Mr.
Currier, or all of the other members of the public, as a medium by
which any music could be read. That is the only practicable way of
reading it, and that was left to the inventor. A mere reversal of that
scale, to read backwards, would not be requisite.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I would like to ask the gentleman a question. What
value would these various records have if my march was not on them&mdash;if
I had never written that march?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I will say to Mr. Sousa with perfect frankness
that the only object of that particular record is to produce his march.
[Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Without my consent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I shall not try to hedge. I merely state facts.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Do you think you should do that without
compensating him for the genius he displayed?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Very early in my remarks I disavowed any such
intention. I did say that we were in the position&mdash;the independent
manufacturers that I represent&mdash;where we could be forced to the wall
because of these contracts, and that the resulting benefits to Mr.
Sousa and Mr. Herbert, if Congress had power to and did pass such an
act, would be vastly offset by the great detriment to our manufacturing
interests and to the public.
</p>

<p>
While I am on that point I would ask leave to digress and to submit
also a copy of a letter from the Æolian Company to the Chicago Music
Company, dated the 5th of May, 1902, and offer it in evidence here.
</p>

<p>
(The letter referred to is as follows:)
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
<span class="sc">The Æolian Company</span>,
<br><i>New York, May 5, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chicago Music Company</span>,
<br><i>Music Publishers, Chicago, Ill</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Sirs</span>: Pursuant to the provision of the agreement
granting us the exclusive right under your United States copyrights
for all perforated music sheets intended for use in controlling
automatic musical instruments and machines for playing musical
instruments, we hereby notify you that a number of copyright owners
satisfactory to us have made with us agreements similar to our
agreement with you. From this date, therefore, our agreement goes
into effect.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to profitable and pleasant business relations, we
remain,
</p>

<p>
Yours, truly,
</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="sc">The Æolian Company</span>,
<br><span class="sc">E. R. Perkins</span>, <i>General Manager</i>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
I now ask you, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, to turn to section 15 of the
bill, found at page 11 of the House bill, which would seem to me to be
rather ambiguous. It provides that the owner of the copyright may
commence proceedings and so forth within thirty days, but that he has a
whole year within which to complete his copyright. Now, that means that
he does not have to put his mark on it, I suppose, and perhaps an
independent manufacturer may go ahead for a year, or, rather, for three
hundred and sixty-four days, believing that he has the right to do so,
and then, on the three hundred and sixty-fifth day the owner of the
copyright completes his record, and he is promptly sued for all that he
has done for the past year. True, the act says that in such case no
action shall be brought for infringement of the copyright until the
requirements have been fully complied with; but that merely says that
he can not commence the action until he has complied with the act. It
does not say that after he has finally complied he can not recover for
the infringement during the full year within which he practically
permitted his copyright to lapse.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Do you understand that he is not obliged to give
notice during the intervening period?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I am speaking of the one-year provision.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. The works that are issued carry a notice, do they
not? You did not understand that it was supposed that the works issued
were to be exempt from the notice upon them of copyright, did you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I would like to know what is the reason for the
provision in question, then. If there is no reason for it, it should
not be there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Then you would strike out all of section 15?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Why not leave the act as it is, and provide
that everything must be done before publication, instead of giving them
a year in which they might possibly deceive the public?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. O'Connell has asked what is the reason for
this section. I will ask you, Mr. O'Connell, if you have observed that
the section reads, this section 15, that "if, by reason of any error or
omission the requirements prescribed above in section 11 have not been
complied with," etc. Now, notice that section 11 does not refer to the
requirement of notice upon the published works, but of the requirement
of deposit and registration in the copyright office.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. In answer to that I will say that the Patent
Committees of both Houses are probably aware of the fact that there
have been means found and adopted for many, many years to keep
applications for patents pending in the Patent Office and still not
have them outlawed. It would be the easiest thing in the world for an
applicant for a copyright to commit irregularities for that very
purpose.
</p>

<p>
Another point: In section 18, subdivision C, there may be a copyright
obtained under an assumed name. I confess that I do not see the reason
for that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Mark Twain, for instance, instead of Samuel L.
Clemens? Is there objection to that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I do not see the reason for it, while it might
be all right in the particular instance which you suggest. Of course if
it is limited to giving a copyright to a man under his pen name, that
might be all right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Is not that the purpose of it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. It may be the particular purpose of it, but I
think the section is so broad that it might include almost anything
from Genesis to Revelations.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Where is that in section 18, that you may
copyright under an assumed name? Will you state where you find that in
that section?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. On page 15:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The copyright in a work published anonymously or under an assumed
name shall subsist for the same period as if the work had been
produced bearing the author's true name.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is at the end of section 18. That would seem to me to give the right
to copyright under an assumed name.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Oh, yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. As to the penalties, Mr. Chairman, I think
there never has been an act passed where the penalties have been so
severe. I will ask you, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, to turn to section
23, on page 17, of the bill and I will point out as far as I may where
it differs from the old act. In the first place, subdivision A gives
the right to an injunction restraining such infringement. As to the
damages, in addition to the injunction, it gives the copyright
proprietor such damages as he may have suffered. In addition to the
injunction and the damages, it gives him the right to all the profits
which the infringer may have made from such infringement. And now comes
the extraordinary provision. It says: "And in proving profits the
plaintiff shall be required to prove sales only"&mdash;gross sales, I
suppose it meant thereby&mdash;"and defendant shall be required to prove
every element of cost which he claims."
</p>

<p>
That provision is revolutionary. In every case, both at law and in
equity, where the plaintiff has to prove either damages or loss of
profits, it is absolutely essential that he prove the actual damages or
the actual profits. By that is not meant gross profits, but the net
profits which the infringer has made. Under this act all that the
plaintiff is required to do would be to prove that the alleged
infringer sold so many goods for such and such a price, and the onus or
burden of proof is entirely on the defendant to establish all the items
of the expense incurred in producing the infringing article. The old
act has no such provision.
</p>

<p>
Next it says that in lieu of damages and profits the court&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. It says "actual damages."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. It says that the court, instead of actual
damages and profits, may award an arbitrary sum, not less than $250 nor
more than $5,000, and it says that that sum shall be made up in this
way: For every copy of a music roll or a phonograph record, $10. The
old act provided for practically the same kind of a record, the same
genesis of things, $1. Why, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, should you
impose a penalty of $10? The old act has it that paintings, statues, or
sculptures should pay a penalty of $10. It also has it that prints,
etc., should pay $1. Why should you put a music roll into the category
of paintings, statues, or sculptures at $10, rather than into the other
category?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. We will submit an amendment making that $1. The
music publishers will submit an amendment making that $1.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I thank the music publishers for considering
us, even in the very slightest degree.
</p>

<p>
Five thousand dollars would seem to be the limit in any one suit, but
suppose the complainant brings 20 or 50 different suits in different
jurisdictions, which he would be permitted to do under other sections
of the act, which I will point out presently.
</p>

<p>
Subdivision third of that section 23, says: "In the case of a dramatic
or musical composition not less than $100 for the first and not less
than $50 for every subsequent infringing performance."
</p>

<p>
I submit, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, that we are also liable to that
penalty as well as the $10 a roll, because these very astute gentlemen
who are back of this bill, on the very first infringement will claim
that any performance on an automatic piano player whereby Mr. Sousa's
march or Mr. Herbert's composition is played on a pianola or one of the
independent pianos, is a musical performance, and that for the first
performance, in addition to the $10 a roll, we are liable to be fined
$100, and for each subsequent performance $50. I think that this
section, if the other provisions of the bill are to remain in, should
be amended so as to say that this shall not include a performance on a
perforated music roll or on phonograph or music machine disks.
</p>

<p>
Some other extraordinary provisions of the penalties are, first, this
subdivision C of the fourth paragraph of section 23 provides that the
infringer is&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
to deliver up on oath to be impounded during the pendency of the
action, upon such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe,
all goods alleged to infringe a copyright.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That is an extraordinary provision. They get an injunction pendente
lite, and not alone that, but we have to deliver up to them everything
pendente lite. The injunction is not good enough, and we have to give
the goods to them.
</p>

<p>
Next, it says (subsection D):
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
To deliver up, on oath, for destruction all the infringing copies
or devices, as well as all plates, molds, matrices, or other means
for making such infringing copies.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It may be proper, as in the old act, to direct the infringer to deliver
up the copies or the plates from which they are made, but it is
absolutely revolutionary to direct that the machinery be delivered up,
because that machinery may be useful for perfectly legitimate purposes,
and yet it must be delivered up for destruction.
</p>

<p>
It also provides that all those results can be obtained in a single
action.
</p>

<p>
As to the jurisdiction of courts in suits of this kind, here is the
provision of the bill:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 32.</span> That all actions arising under the copyright laws
of the United States shall be originally cognizable by the circuit
courts of the United States, the district court of any Territory,
the supreme court of the District of Columbia, the district courts
of Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, and the courts of first instance
of the Philippine Islands.
</p>

<p>
Actions arising under this act may be instituted in the district of
which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in the district where the
violation of any provision of this act has occurred.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let us assume that my client, a manufacturer of an automatic piano
player in the city of New York, ships one of these with a box of music
rolls to Manila or some inland town in the Philippines. If it is an
infringement, the infringement has occurred in the Philippines, because
the music roll is not published until it is taken out of the box.
According to this act they have a right to commence an action in the
Philippine Islands. According to another subsection of section 32 they
can send the process to the marshal in the southern district of New
York, and that marshal serves the process, and thereupon the court of
first instance in the Philippine Islands has jurisdiction, and the
defendant has to go to the Philippine Islands to defend the case. And a
still greater objection is that the complainant in such an action may
commence a hundred concurrent suits and distribute them in every court
in the United States, the Territories, Porto Rico, and the Philippines.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. The idea, of course, is to put it within the reach
of these people who are injured.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Does that put it within the reach of the New
York corporation, or is it part of their proper proceedings to get
damages or redress that they should go to the Philippine Islands to sue
my clients who are domiciled in New York, where the Æolian Company is
domiciled, and make us go over there to defend the suit?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. No; but suppose the person injured lives in the
Philippine Islands?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. If that is the conclusion, if you simply want
the plaintiff to sue in the jurisdiction where either the real
plaintiff or the defendant is an inhabitant, then that raises another
question.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Evidently that is what has been intended. There
was no purpose of anybody to take all the fellows out of New York,
because that is a splendid place to live, you know. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. But we have to come to the fountainhead
occasionally. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. The act distinctly says "In the district where any
violation of this act has occurred."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Under the old provision with regard to
infringement, you could only sue a defendant where you found him, in
the district where he resided. That is the provision in relation to
patents, and the provision of the bill as the old act stands. Why
should this new provision be inserted? Perhaps the members of this
committee will be able to determine.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I take it that that was for the purpose of making
it convenient to the person injured, or the parties injured.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. That might be all right, if the party injured
was a resident of the Philippines.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Or of the Sandwich Islands, or Porto Rico?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That is the idea.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I think you will find that there are none of
the owners of any of these copyrights living in any of those districts;
none of them. I do not suppose that Mr. Sousa intends to change his
residence just at present, or Mr. Herbert either. I think they will be
found doing business here right along. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Section 34 provides&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That no action shall be maintained under the provisions of this act
unless the same is commenced within three years after the cause of
action arose.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Why not leave that the old two-year limit? What is the necessity for
three years? There is no reason for that.
</p>

<p>
Then, look at the provision in section 35.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Is there a disadvantage in putting it three years?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. Why should it be extended to three years?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Is it not true that the present limitation is only
for actions for penalties or forfeitures, whereas this is a general
limitation on all actions, including civil actions for infringement, so
that although it enlarges by one year the criminal action, it reduces
the term that the complainant at present has in his civil action? This
now applies to all actions. Did you notice that, Mr. O'Connell?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. I think that the present provision relating to
kindred actions of this kind is a two-year statute of limitations, and
it has been found ample for a great many years, for all purposes, to
protect patentees, inventors, and everybody else.
</p>

<p>
Look at section 35:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That in all recoveries under this act full costs shall be allowed.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That is to say, where the complainant recovers he must get from the
defendant, and the court must allow the complainant, full costs. Let us
assume a case where the defendant gets the bill dismissed. That is not
a recovery. He does not get a recovery, but there is no provision
giving the defendant in that case full costs. Oh, no. They are only
careful of the complainant where he recovers; but where his action
fails there is no provision giving the defendant full costs.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You would strike out "recoveries" and insert
"suits?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">O'Connell</span>. If you want to do it that way. You will not be
then giving one side any more than the other. But I think that
provision should not be in there at all. I think the court should have
full discretion in the award of costs, these actions being mostly
equitable actions, and the general rule being that in a court of equity
the awarding or denial of costs is in the discretion of the court.
</p>

<p>
I see no reason why the jurisdiction of the courts should be limited by
a provision of this kind. I think it should be left to the courts to
say in all cases whether costs should be awarded or withheld, and how
much costs should be awarded; although I think there should be a
provision to the effect that in the case of an action wilfully brought,
and where there is no recovery&mdash;brought simply for the purpose of
intimidation, where there is no reasonable ground for recovery, simply
to get hold of the man's business and keep him from doing
business&mdash;that there should be some provision in there giving a penalty
against the complainant in such an action as that. I have only thought
of that at this moment, but I think it is a good suggestion to make to
the committee.
</p>

<p>
Gentlemen, I thank you for the time you have given me, and I have no
more to say on the subject. I again ask, however, as I did at the
outset, that on these contracts and on the question of the monopoly in
the hands of this concern and its associates, the committee should take
proofs such as may be necessary to determine what the situation is. All
I ask on behalf of the independent manufacturers of automatic musical
instruments in the United States is that we should have a fair show,
that our business should have the same protection as any other business
has, and that you gentlemen may not do anything which will help this
great centralization and put it in the power or a monopoly to ruin our
business.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I understand that Mr. H. N. <span class="sc">Low</span> is by
agreement to speak next.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF H. N. LOW, ESQ., OF WASHINGTON, D.C.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Low</span>. I appear for the manufacturers of the music rolls and
of instruments operated by such rolls.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I understood that the music-roll people had had
over two hours now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Low</span>. Pardon me. My remarks will be very brief.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. The talking-machine people are to have thirty
minutes, and the committee can not sit here a very great while.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Low</span>. My suggestions will be very brief.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. We have to adjourn in a little while, and
the gentleman who preceded you exceeded his time.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Low</span>. Then to merely supplement the remarks of the
gentleman who has preceded me, I ask leave of the committee to submit
two more contracts, similar to the ones that he has submitted, with the
Æolian Company in the carrying out of the agreement that we allege. My
information is that that agreement now embraces practically the whole
music-publishing trade, and those outside of that agreement are very
small manufacturers, and the trust or combination is just about
complete and ready for this legislation. I submit that this legislation
is most dangerous, and that this pretended revision of the copyright
law is a cloak for something that is very wrong.
</p>

<p>
[The contracts referred to by Mr. <span class="sc">Low</span> are as follows:]
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this 30th day of
April, 1902, by and between Chicago Music Company, of Chicago, in
the State of Illinois, party of the first part, hereinafter called
the publisher, and the Æolian Company, a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of Connecticut, and having a place of
business in the city of New York, in the State of New York, party
of the second part, hereinafter called the Æolian Company,
witnesseth:
</p>

<p>
That whereas the publisher is the proprietor of certain copyrights
for musical compositions and the owner of rights in copyrights for
other musical compositions; and
</p>

<p>
Whereas the Æolian Company is engaged in the business of
manufacturing and selling automatic musical instruments controlled
by perforated music sheets, and in manufacturing and selling
machines for playing keyboard musical instruments, which machines
are controlled by perforated music sheets, and in manufacturing and
selling perforated music sheets for such automatic musical
instruments and machines; and
</p>

<p>
Whereas the Æolian Company is desirous of acquiring the exclusive
right for such perforated music sheets in and to all the
copyrighted musical compositions of which the publisher is the
proprietor, or as to which he is the owner of any rights, and of
all those other musical compositions which may hereafter be
protected by copyright, and the copyrights for which or rights in
which may be acquired by him;
</p>

<p>
Now, therefore, the publisher, for and in consideration of the
premises, and of the sum of $1, lawful money of the United States,
to him paid by the Æolian Company, receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, and for and in consideration of the true and faithful
performance by the Æolian Company of its covenants hereinafter
made, does hereby sell, assign, transfer, and set over unto the
Æolian Company the exclusive right for all perforated music sheets
of the kinds aforesaid in and to all the copyrighted musical
compositions of which the publisher is the proprietor, or in the
case in which he is the owner of any less rights, to the extent of
said rights, and does hereby covenant and agree with the Æolian
Company to give and secure to it the exclusive right in like manner
for all perforated music sheets of the kinds aforesaid in and to
all those other musical compositions which may hereafter be
protected by copyright, and the copyrights or rights in which may
be acquired by the publisher, except that if the Æolian Company do
not accept any price offered them within three months after said
offer, then the publisher may be at liberty to dispose of the same
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
And the publisher, for the consideration aforesaid, hereby
covenants and agrees, so far as it may be reasonably in his power,
to protect the Æolian Company against any claim of any third person
in respect to any and all copyrighted musical compositions which
may be involved in this agreement, and the copyright of which may
be owned by the publisher.
</p>

<p>
And the Æolian Company, for and in consideration of the premises,
hereby agrees that it will keep correct and true books of account
in which it will set down or cause to be set down entries of all
perforated music sheets made by it for playing the copyrighted
musical compositions owned or controlled by the publisher; that it
will on the 20th day of each and every January and July, during the
continuance of the manufacture and sale by it of the perforated
music sheets for playing such musical compositions, render unto the
publisher a correct and true statement of the number, names, and
other designations of such perforated music sheets sold by it
during the six preceding calendar months, and that at the time of
rendering each and every such statement it will well and truly pay
unto the publisher a license fee or royalty of 10 per cent of the
list prices made by the United States publishers of the printed
scores or copies of such musical compositions, but never more than
50 cents for any one of such perforated music sheets.
</p>

<p>
And the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree that nothing
herein contained is to obligate the Æolian Company to pay any
license fee or royalty upon such perforated music sheets as shall
be made by it in the United States and sold or shipped to any other
country, unless it shall have been decided by a court of competent
jurisdiction of such other country that the copyright laws of that
country shall be applicable to perforated music sheets of the kinds
herein mentioned.
</p>

<p>
And the parties hereto mutually agree and covenant that the term
"perforated music sheets" is not to be construed as covering the
controllers of those musical instruments which are generally known
as phonographs, or music boxes, or hand organs.
</p>

<p>
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, at the expiration
of thirty-five years from the payment of the first license fee
hereinbefore provided, the Æolian Company shall not be entitled to
licenses under the copyrights thereafter acquired by the publisher,
but all licenses existing under copyrights theretofore acquired by
him shall remain in force until the expiration of the terms of the
copyrights under the terms hereinbefore provided.
</p>

<p>
During the existence of this contract, after the payment of the
license fee hereunder, the Æolian Company obligates itself to
prosecute diligently, at its own expense and by its own counsel, in
the name of the proprietors of the copyright, all infringers of the
rights granted to it, the Æolian Company.
</p>

<p>
And the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree that all the
provisions of this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
successors, executors, administrators, and personal representatives
of both the parties hereto.
</p>

<p>
In witness whereof the publisher has on the day and year first
hereinabove written hereunto set his hand and seal, and the Æolian
Company has caused its name and corporate seal to be hereunto
affixed by its proper officer thereunto duly authorized.

<p>
Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this 30th day of
April, 1902, by and between Chicago Music Company, of Chicago, in
the State of Illinois, party of the first part, hereinafter called
the publisher, and the Æolian Company, a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of Connecticut, and having a place of
business in the city of New York, in the State of New York, party
of the second part, hereinafter called the Æolian Company,
witnesseth:
</p>

<p>
That whereas the parties hereto have, of even date herewith,
entered into an agreement whereby the Æolian Company is to have the
exclusive right for all perforated music sheets intended for use in
controlling automatic musical instruments or machines for playing
musical instruments, in and to the copyrighted musical compositions
of which the publisher is the proprietor or as to which he is the
owner of any rights, and in and to all those other musical
compositions which may hereafter be protected by copyright and the
copyrights or rights in which may be acquired by him; and
</p>

<p>
Whereas the parties hereto are desirous of entering into a further
agreement with reference to the matters and things expressed in the
above-mentioned agreement of even date herewith;
</p>

<p>
Now, therefore, the publisher, for and in consideration of the
premises and the sum of $1, lawful money of the United States, to
him by the Æolian Company in hand paid, receipt whereof is hereby
acknowledged, does hereby covenant and agree that no charge shall
be exacted from or be due from the Æolian Company for the
manufacture or sale by it, or any of its customers, of any
perforated music sheets of either of the kinds aforesaid, for
playing any of the copyrighted musical compositions which are owned
or controlled, or which shall hereafter be owned or controlled in
whole or in part by the publisher, until a decision of the court of
last resort in a suit which is to be instituted against some
manufacturer or user, other than the Æolian Company, of such
perforated music sheets for the purpose of testing the
applicability of the United States copyright laws to such
perforated music sheets, and not then unless such decision shall
uphold the applicability of the United States copyright laws to
perforated music sheets of the kinds aforesaid.
</p>

<p>
And for and in consideration of the premises the Æolian Company
hereby covenants and agrees to pay all proper expenses of
conducting said suit for the purpose of testing the applicability
of the United States copyright laws to perforated music sheets of
the kinds aforesaid, and that if the court of last resort shall in
such suit decide that the United States copyright laws are
applicable to such perforated music sheets, then and in such case
and from that time forward the Æolian Company will keep books of
account, render statements, and pay royalties, as provided by the
aforesaid agreement of even date herewith, but shall be free from
obligation to make payments for the past.
</p>

<p>
And it is mutually understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
neither party hereto is to be obligated in any way by any of the
provisions of this agreement, or of the aforesaid agreement of even
date herewith, until the Æolian Company shall notify the publisher
that a number of copyright owners, satisfactory to the Æolian
Company, have made similar agreements with said company.
</p>

<p>
And the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree that all the
provisions of this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
successors, executors, administrators, and personal representatives
of both the parties hereto.
</p>

<p>
In witness whereof the publisher has on the day and year first

1. The contracts which have heretofore been entered into in
anticipation of this legislation, four of which contracts have been
filed in connection with the remarks of Mr. O'Connell and of Mr.
Low.
</p>

<p>
2. New legislation of the character proposed by this copyright bill
and especially by paragraph (g) of section 1.
</p>

<p>
In one of the contracts referred to, dated April 30, 1902, between
the Chicago Music Company and the Æolian Company, it is provided&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"During the existence of this contract, after the payment of the
license fee thereunder, the Æolian Company obligates itself to
prosecute diligently, at its own expense and by its own counsel, in
the name of the proprietors of the copyright, all infringers of the
rights granted to it, the Æolian Company."
</p>

<p>
In the other contract of the same date and between the same
parties, a facsimile of which has been filed with your committees,
it is provided&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That no charge shall be exacted from or be due from the Æolian
Company <span class="asterisk">* * *</span> until a decision of the court of last resort in a
suit which is to be instituted against some manufacturer or user
other than the Æolian Company of such perforated music sheets for
the purpose of testing the applicability of the United States
copyright laws to perforated music sheets, and not then unless such
decision shall uphold the applicability of the United States
copyright laws to perforated music sheets of the kinds aforesaid.
And for and in consideration of the premises the Æolian Company
hereby covenants and agrees to pay all proper expenses of
conducting said suit," etc.
</p>

<p>
Such test suit was instituted entitled The White-Smith Music
Publishing Company <i>v.</i> The Apollo Company by and at the
expense of the Æolian Company, the real complainant, and decided
against the Æolian Company, the holding of the court of last
resort, the United States circuit court of appeals for the second
circuit, being that such perforated music sheets were not
infringements of the copyrights of the nominal complainant.
</p>

<p>
Although defeated so far, it is not reasonable to suppose that the
combination of the Æolian Company and its "number of copyright
owners satisfactory" to that company would rest without further
effort to make effective for profit the agreement into which they
had entered. The only remaining means was by new legislation, and I
submit that the aim and end of the pending bill is to be a
substitute for that favorable decision of a court of last resort
which the Æolian Company failed after strenuous efforts to obtain.
</p>

<p>
Certain provisions of the bill here and there&mdash;for example, the
lengthening of the copyright term&mdash;have attracted to the support of
the bill various interests who are totally indifferent one way or
the other to the question of perforated music sheets or
phonographic records, but I submit that these other provisions are
more or less unimportant, do not improve the present law, and most
of them would never have been heard of except for the desire of the
special interests above referred to to obtain new legislation as to
the mechanical producers of sound.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1904 attempt was made by this same combination to
obtain the legislation desired by the insertion of a specific
provision in the law to substantially this effect:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Provided</i>, That in the case of a musical composition authors
or their assigns shall have the exclusive right to use said
copyright musical compositions in the form of perforated rolls for
playing attachments, copyright on which music rolls may be obtained
by said author or his assigns in the same manner as now provided by
law for copyright on musical compositions."
</p>

<p>
I have not been able to discover that this proposed amendment of
the law was ever introduced in the form of a bill into either House
of Congress. It may have been. But I am informed that it was
formulated for the purpose of introduction as a bill in Congress in
the terms above set forth.
</p>

<p>
It was found impracticable to obtain the new legislation in such
specific and undisguised form, and resort is now had to a pretended
revision or codification of the entire copyright law, for which
there is not the slightest necessity and which will inevitably give
rise to a great amount of litigation before the meaning and effect
of the words used in the new law can be legally understood, for the
sole purpose that the Æolian Company may have with its contracting
publishers and copyright owners "pleasant and profitable business
relations," as expressed in the notice from the Æolian Company to
the contracting publishers, dated May 5, 1902 (a facsimile of which
I have filed with your committees). This notice states "a number a
copyright owners satisfactory to us have made with us agreements
similar to our agreement with you."
</p>

<p>
Although the matters above referred to have been opened up before
your committee in the remarks of Mr. O'Connell, I have felt it my
duty to give my view of the matter in brief form, both in
confirmation of what Mr. O'Connell has said, and for the purpose of
indicating that the bill itself and proposed amendments thereto
must be scrutinized by your committees with the greatest care
before it is reported.
</p>

<p>
As to amendments of the bill, I see no alternative to the striking
out of paragraph (g) of section 1. If the combine exists as is
alleged it is obvious that the patents, inventions, machinery, and
plants of all those manufacturers of mechanical records who are not
inside of the combine, that is to say, of all the manufacturers of
perforated music rolls excepting the Æolian Company, and all the
manufacturers of talking machines and records excepting the two
companies who are alleged to be members of another combination or
trust for the exclusive manufacture of such machines, and of all
without exception of the manufacturers and users and sellers of
pianos and organs which are operated by perforated music sheets,
will be rendered practically useless, the owners of such
manufactories will be put out of business, and their workmen will
have their field of labor and bread taken away.
</p>

<p>
If this will be the result of the bill, and especially of the
paragraph section 1 (g), the bill is most unjust and class
legislation of the worst type. And that is just what the bill is
intended to be, but I am thankful that its object can not be
concealed.
</p>

<p>
It is no answer to the above objection to say that the bill
provides only for the future. So do the contracts between the
Æolian Company and its "satisfactory number" of copyright owners.
The said contracts are unlimited as to time, having been signed by
the great bulk of the trade (meaning thereby almost all of the
great music publishers of the country), they leave outside of the
combination only small publishers, and the contracts provide as
follows:
</p>

<p>
"Now, therefore, the publisher, for and in consideration of the
premises, and of the sum of one dollar, lawful money of the United
States, to him paid by the Æolian Company, receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, and for and in consideration of the true and
faithful performance by the Æolian Company of its covenants
hereinafter made, does hereby sell, assign, transfer, and set over
unto the Æolian Company the exclusive right for all perforated
music sheets of the kinds aforesaid in and to all the copyrighted
compositions of which the publisher is the proprietor, or in the
case in which he is the owner of any less rights, to the extent of
said rights, and does hereby covenant and agree with the Æolian
Company to give and secure to it the exclusive right in like manner
for all perforated music sheets of the kinds aforesaid in and to
all those other musical compositions which may hereafter be
protected by copyright, and the copyrights or rights in which may
be acquired by the publisher, except that if the Æolian Company do
not accept any piece offered them within three months after said
offer then the publisher may be at liberty to dispose of the same
otherwise."
</p>

<p>
From the foregoing we arrive at this conclusion, and there is no
escape from it, that there is in existence a combination whose
design and effect upon very important business and laboring
interests of this country will be injurious and unlawful if the
bill should be passed as proposed, which combination is of
unlimited duration as to time, and which combination will control,
for the purpose of producing perforated music sheets, all the
copyrights or rights of production hereafter for such unlimited
duration of time which may be acquired by the great bulk of the
trade (music publishers) of this country. Your committees will see,
therefore, that the bill provides for the profitable future of the
members of the combination without limit as to time.
</p>

<p>
The result of this will be threefold:
</p>

<p>
1. The Æolian Company will secure for itself practically the entire
business of the United States in the manufacture of perforated
music sheets, and will be in a position to dictate the prices for
such sheets to the trade, including the manufacturers and sellers
of pianos and organs operated by said sheets as well as the sellers
of the sheets alone, and to raise the price to the public generally
for such sheets.
</p>

<p>
2. The publishers who have contracted with the Æolian Company to
give the latter all the rights which the publishers have or may
have in copyrighted music will receive from the Æolian Company
certain royalties, which royalties will either be clear profit to
the publishers or will be less than any extra royalties which the
publishers will pay to the composers. It is practically certain
that in the long run the composers will get no more royalties than
they now receive, for the composer, for his own advantage in
obtaining a large sale of his works, must go to one of the large
publishers of music, and will be compelled by such publisher to
accept in full payment of his copyright just such a royalty as he
now gets under existing law, and all the extra profits which can be
mulcted from the public under section 1 (g) of the bill will be
divided between the members of the combination.
</p>

<p>
3. The public will foot all the bills without any more advantage to
themselves than they have under existing law.
</p>

<p>
The assertion made in support of the bill, that it relates only to
the future, is completely met with the reply that the bill does not
provide for the future of anyone who is outside of the combination.
</p>

<p>
If the existing copyright law is bad or insufficient and anything
like a revision of or a codification of the copyright statutes in a
new law must be made in the interests of justice, let it be done.
But let care be taken that you do not do injustice. If a new
copyright law is to be enacted, and the pending bill is to be the
foundation of such a law, the practical question is, how is it to
be amended in order that it may not cause the evils above referred
to.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Putnam in his introductory remarks indicated that your
committees would find evidences of "selfishness" in the bill. He is
undoubtedly right. It is, however, much more far reaching in this
respect than Mr. Putnam had any idea of. It is extraordinary that
the conference which advised Mr. Putnam adopted such radical
legislation as is proposed in section 1 (g) without inviting the
attendance at the conference of a single person interested
adversely to this legislation. In fact it would appear that such
persons were purposely kept in ignorance of what the conference was
doing.
</p>

<p>
But I do not think that the selfishness of the interests which are
opposed to the said new legislation, and who are now fully aware
that it is proposed, extends beyond a rightful effort to prevent
their own extinction.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion the manufacturers of mechanical music controllers or
records are willing to pay a fair and reasonable royalty to
composers of music which they use, or to other owners of copyrights
for musical compositions, but this must be provided for otherwise
than by an enactment which will give rise to the evils attending
the said paragraph, section 1 (g) of the bill. That paragraph
should be eliminated and other parts of the bill corresponding with
this paragraph, and there should be substituted for it, probably at
some other more appropriate part of the bill, a provision like the
following:
</p>

<p>
"Any person, firm, or corporation who shall make, use, or sell, or
let for hire, any device, contrivance, or appliance especially
adapted in any manner whatsoever to reproduce to the ear the whole
or any material part of any work published and copyrighted after
this act shall have gone into effect, shall pay to the author or
composer of such work a fair and reasonable royalty to be
determined according to the market price for such or similar
royalties.
</p>

<p>
"And the author or composer of the work so used shall have the same
remedies for the recovery from such person, firm, or corporation of
such royalty or royalties as is provided in this act for the
recovery of damages for the infringement of copyright.
</p>

<p>
"And after the amount of such royalty or royalties shall have been
ascertained and become due by express contract between the parties,
or shall have been ascertained and adjudged to be due by any
circuit court of the United States, and is not paid, then the
author or composer shall have the same remedy by injunction against
such person, firm, or corporation, as is provided in this act in
cases of the infringement of a copyright."
</p>

<p>
It is believed that such an enactment would give to the composers
who have appeared before your committees all the rights and
remuneration which is due them, and at the same time will defeat
the unlawful combination which exists and is hereinbefore referred
to.
</p>

<p>
I believe that it will not be at all difficult to arrive at the
just value of such royalties, and in almost every instance they
would be settled by contract between the owner of the copyright and
the maker of the mechanical appliance for producing the music. In
the case of a composition of any value the composer will dispose of
it for an agreed-upon royalty to some music publisher in the usual
way. He will then dispose of his right to the composition for
reproduction by mechanical means to some manufacturer of such
mechanical means for a royalty agreed upon. If any other such
manufacturer, not in contractual relations with the owner of the
copyright thereafter makes use of the composition, the amount of
the royalty for which the owner of the copyright has contracted
will aid in determining what royalty is fair and reasonable and is
to be paid by such other manufacturer. I suppose that in some cases
litigation may be necessary to arrive at the amount of the royalty,
but not more than is inevitable in human affairs. It is not to be
supposed that a manufacturer will resist the payment of the royalty
for a musical composition which he has utilized and pay to the
complainant the cost of litigation rather than make a fair
settlement upon terms which are well settled, or will soon become
well settled under this act, in the trade.
</p>

<p>
A provision like that above suggested is analogous to, and appears
to be quite similar in its effect to, the compulsory-license
provision of some of the foreign statutes. For instance, in the law
of the Dominion of Canada, lately enacted, in 1903, we have the
following:
</p>

<p>
"7. (<i>a</i>) Any person, at any time while a patent continues in
force, may apply to the commissioner, by petition, for a license to
make, construct, use, and sell the patented invention, and the
commissioner shall, subject to general rules to be made for
carrying out this section, hear the person applying and the owner
of the patent, and if he is satisfied that the reasonable
requirements of the public in reference to the invention have not
been satisfied by reason of the neglect or refusal of the patentee
or his legal representatives to make, construct, use, or sell the
invention, or to grant licenses to others on reasonable terms to
make, construct, use, or sell the same, may make an order under his
hand and seal of the patent office requiring the owner of the
patent to grant a license to the person applying therefor, in such
form and upon such terms as to the duration of the license, the
amount of the royalties, security for payment, and otherwise, as
the commissioner, having regard to the nature of the invention and
the circumstances of the case, deems just."
</p>

<p>
I instance this foreign law to show that under a system of
jurisprudence exactly like our own it has been found best to limit
rights heretofore granted in the most exclusive form, and provide
for compelling the owners of such rights to deal reasonably and
fairly with the public. This Canadian law relates to exclusive
rights to inventions under letters patent, where the ascertainment
of what is a just license fee or royalty is always more or less
complicated and difficult. In the case of copyrights much simpler
conditions prevail, the value of musical compositions are more
easily measurable and there would be far less difficulty in
arriving at a fair royalty by a contract between the parties or by
arbitration, or, in the last resort, by the judgment of a circuit
court. I have mentioned a circuit court merely for purpose of
illustration. It would probably be more convenient to confer this
jurisdiction on a United States district court.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that under the conditions which confront your
committees, there being on the one hand a desire to recompense
musical composers, and on the other hand the necessity of defeating
the unlawful combination which will have entrenched itself most
securely if the bill should become a law including the
objectionable paragraph which I have discussed, an amendment of the
bill in some such way as above indicated is inevitable.
</p>



<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">SPECIFIC AMENDMENT OF THE BILL.
</p>

<p>
I submit that in the interest of the public it is far better to
correct any evil in the existing copyright law, which was pretty
thoroughly revised not very many years ago, than to pass a revision
of the law which uses so many new terms and words which have not
received judicial interpretation, and which bill evidently requires
itself revision and amendment in almost every section. It requires
such amendment in detail in the first place to eliminate those
matters which have been embodied in the bill for the purpose of
most thoroughly carrying out the provisions of section 1 (g), upon
which I have already commented. If it is necessary to eliminate the
paragraph specified, it is also necessary to revise the bill in
many other sections where corresponding matter appears.
</p>

<p>
In the second place, the bill requires amendment as to the term of
copyright proposed, as to the damages for infringement, as to the
effect which the certificate of the filing of the entry shall have,
as to the way in which and the terms in which the notice of
copyright shall be given, and as to broad and uncertain expressions
which are found in many sections, which can have no good effect and
which will only be productive of uncertainty, confusion, and
litigation.
</p>

<p>
I am informed that a substitute bill will be submitted to your
committees in the nature of specific amendments to the existing law
to cure any evils which may exist therein and, among other things,
to give reasonable compensation to authors or composers for the use
of their works by the manufacturers of automatic mechanical
reproducing devices. I believe that it will be preferable to thus
amend existing law, leaving the great bulk of the law in those
words and terms and provisions which there is no necessity of
changing and which have become well understood by years of judicial
interpretation.
</p>

<p>
I will however proceed to discuss the pending bill and point out
the specific amendments which appear to be necessary in the
interest of the public, both as to clearness and certainty of
expression and as to the relative just claims of the author and of
the public.
</p>

<p>
Section 1, paragraph (f), should be amended by striking out the
words "or for purpose" and the remainder of line 10 and to the end
of line 13, and by inserting the words "or to make any variation,
adaptation, or arrangement thereof."
</p>

<p>
It will be seen that to retain this paragraph in the present form
would be equivalent to retaining paragraph (g), because it was the
intent in framing paragraph (f) to have the word "performance"
cover the operation of an automatic mechanical device; and the
words "arrangement or setting" were intended to include the
production of a perforated music sheet.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph (g) should be eliminated for the reasons already given.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph (h) should be amended by inserting at the end thereof the
words "amounting to a copy thereof."
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that this paragraph is altogether too broad and
uncertain. The paragraph should only protect against infringements
which are copies, and it must be left to judicial determination in
the future as it has been in the past to say whether or not any
particular abridgment, adaptation, or arrangement is a copy within
the meaning of the law.
</p>

<p>
Section 2 appears to be substantially similar to section 36, and
one of the two sections should be eliminated or they should be
consolidated.
</p>

<p>
Section 3 should be amended by striking out "the copyrightable" and
the rest of line 4, and to the end of line 8, and substituting
"matters copyrighted after this act goes into effect."
</p>

<p>
So amended the section does not appear to be necessary in the bill,
but on the other hand in its present form it will be seen at once
that it is retroactive and very injurious, making in effect certain
matters infringements of the copyright granted under existing law
which are not infringements now and are within the public domain.
</p>

<p>
Section 4 is absurdly broad and indefinite and covers pastry or
other works of a cook. It should be amended by inserting the word
"literary" before the word "works," or by substituting the word
"writings," which is used in the Constitution and is the preferable
word to employ, or by inserting after the word "works" the words
"mentioned in section 5 hereof."
</p>

<p>
In section 5 paragraph (h) should be eliminated. This paragraph was
intended to cover perforated music sheets or talking-machine
records which are to be otherwise provided for. As to other matters
it may be said that if the reproductions referred to are copies of
things already copyrighted, they are infringements; if not copies,
they are works of art in themselves under paragraph (g) of section
5.
</p>

<p>
On page 4 "The above specifications shall," in line 8 and line 9
and line 10, to and including the words "nor shall," should be
canceled, and in line 11, after "classification," insert the words
"shall not."
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that an unlimited subject-matter of copyright is
highly undesirable from the standpoint of the public.
</p>

<p>
In section 6, line 15, after "compilations," insert "or," and in
the same line strike out "or other versions." These words are
plainly unnecessary and are intended to have a capability of
elastic interpretation unduly favorable to the author and
prejudicial to the public.
</p>

<p>
In section 7, paragraph (b), the words "of a work" and the rest of
line 6 and lines 7, 8, and 9, to and including the word "text,"
should be canceled. If a work has fallen into the public domain,
even though subsequent to 1891, it would be retroactive to now
bring it within the copyright law and deprive the public of its
use.
</p>

<p>
Section 8, paragraph (a), in the interest of clearness should be
amended by striking out the words "or cotemporaneously" in line 21,
and by inserting after line 22 "shall publish his work within the
limits of the United States cotemporaneously with its first
publication elsewhere; or."
</p>

<p>
Section 9 should be amended by inserting after the word "Act," line
14, the words "and by the performance of the other conditions
precedent mentioned in the act, and by entry of the title of the
work as hereinafter provided." It is plain that a person does not
"secure" copyright by the publication with notice, which is all
that is mentioned in this section.
</p>

<p>
Section 10, line 24, the words "and such registration shall be
prima facie evidence to ownership" should be struck out. There does
not appear to be sufficient reason for giving a mere assertion of
claim the prima facie standing of absolute ownership.
</p>

<p>
It would put upon the true author, whose production had been
entered for copyright by another person, the burden of proof, and
this section if not amended would be very susceptible of fraudulent
use. I am inclined to think that it is advisable, certainly if the
copyright entry is to be prima facie evidence of ownership, to
require that the claim be verified before it is presented to the
Librarian, and that false swearing to such a claim shall subject
the affiant to the penalty for perjury.
</p>

<p>
Section 13, page 9, line 19, "and all his rights and privileges
under said copyright shall thereafter be forfeited" should be
canceled. These words might lead to the unjust forfeiture of a
copyright if the false affidavit were made by the agent or printer
without the knowledge of the author or owner. Also the words seem
superfluous. If a condition precedent has not been performed, the
right is lost by operation of law without these words. To insert
them implies that the provisions of section 13 are not conditions
precedent to obtaining a valid copyright.
</p>

<p>
In line 24 the word "and" should be substituted for "or;" and at
the end of line 25 the words "if it has been published" should be
inserted. It is very desirable that all the facts upon which the
copyright depends should be clearly stated when possible.
</p>

<p>
Section 14, line 2, the words "or the," and the following matter
down to, but not including the word "accompanied," in lines 5 and
6, should be canceled, and the words "with the date of entry of the
copyright" should be inserted.
</p>

<p>
The notice of copyright must be clear and in such usual words, not
signs which hardly anyone will understand, as are intelligible to
the public. I consider it highly important that the date of
copyright, including the year, month, and day, should appear in the
notice, and also the name of the person by whom the original entry
is made in the copyright office. The indexes will be kept by these
names, and any subsequent entry or transfer should always be
indexed under such original names. These remarks apply also to
sections 44 and 45 hereafter considered.
</p>

<p>
In line 10, after "some," the words "uncovered and" should be
inserted.
</p>

<p>
In line 13, after "name," the words "as in the original entry of
copyright" should be inserted.
</p>

<p>
Line 19, the word "its" should be changed to "the," and in line 20,
after "following," the words "of each separate volume" should be
inserted; and in line 24, after "accessible," the word "uncovered"
should be inserted.
</p>

<p>
Page 11, line 3 should be stricken out or amended to cure its
indefiniteness as to the meaning of the word "composite."
</p>

<p>
In line 4, the word "musical" should be changed to
"musical-dramatic."
</p>

<p>
It has never been intended by the copyright law to use the word
"performance," excepting of such works as are only useful when
represented or "performed" in a dramatic sense. The word "dramatic"
has not always seemed sufficiently broad, and the words "musical
composition" have often been added to include operas, oratorios,
and musical works that are not purely dramatic, and yet are
partially so. It is submitted that it has never been the intention
of the law to make the mere singing of a song from copyrighted
notes that have been paid for, or the playing of music,
infringements of copyright, and it is believed that this section
will carry out the full intent of the law if the word "dramatic" be
coupled with the word "musical," as above indicated.
</p>

<p>
In view of the use of the word "performance" in other parts of this
bill for the purpose of including the use of automatic mechanical
devices, it should be made clear that the word "performance," in
line 5, has nothing beyond its ordinary significance. I suggest
that this can best be attained by striking out the word
"performance," in line 5, and inserting the word "representation."
</p>

<p>
Section 15 should be amended by striking out the words "if, by
reason" and the rest of line 11 and lines 12 and 13.
</p>

<p>
It is plain that these words in the bill leave an open door for
free publication which brings a work within the public domain, and
subsequent monopoly of the work upon a mere allegation of error.
The Librarian has not the facilities or legal machinery to try such
question of error, and it should be left to the courts to determine
whether there has been an error or omission, and whether by reason
thereof any condition precedent for a valid copyright has been left
unperformed.
</p>

<p>
Page 12, line 13, the words "bulk of the" should be stricken out.
These words are uncertain and would allow the proprietor to omit
the notice from 49 per cent of the edition. This would clearly
amount to insufficient notice to the public and could be made the
instrument of fraud. Line 14 and the remainder of the section are
entirely sufficient for the purpose without the words "bulk of
the."
</p>

<p>
Section 17, line 22, the words "be extended to" should be canceled,
and at the end of line 24 the words "such term beginning with the
date of filing the request for the reservation of the copyright,"
should be inserted.
</p>

<p>
There appears to be no reason for granting more than the specific
term, which the law will provide, in the case which section 17 is
intended to cover.
</p>

<p>
Section 18 relates to the term of copyright.
</p>

<p>
The whole system provided in the Constitution is for the benefit of
the public, the intent is to accumulate for the use of the public,
matters of literature, art, and invention. The stimulus in the way
of a reward given by the public in return for these matters is
subsidiary to the main object. The reward consists in "securing for
limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their
respective writings and discoveries." The objection to the term
provided in the bill is that it is unconscionably long. It may
easily amount to a hundred years or more, during which time the
public will have paid tribute to the author for something which
will be so old fashioned as to be useless to the public when the
copyright has expired.
</p>

<p>
The word "limited" in the Constitution shows that the framers of
that instrument had in mind to secure for the public certain
benefits after the time had expired. To provide such a long
copyright term as the authors seek to obtain in this bill would
practically defeat the object of the said clause of the
Constitution and the intention of its framers. I submit that it
could only be considered for a moment on the ground that it is a
matter of indifference to the public because the works so to be
protected are entirely useless in themselves. I do not think there
is any sufficient reason for lengthening the term&mdash;twenty-eight
years with an extension of fourteen years&mdash;provided by existing
law.
</p>

<p>
In another respect this section is bad in making the length of the
term dependent upon an event which is uncertain in advance, and of
which no public accessible record may be made when it occurs; that
is to say, the death of the author. I see no reason why a young
author should have longer protection than an old author, and the
provision would leave open to publishers a door of fraud by
securing copyrights for the productions of old authors in the name
of some younger person.
</p>

<p>
The objection to a long term especially applies to music which
depends almost entirely upon fashion and taste, and these soon
change and the music becomes useless to the public. In my opinion,
purely musical productions should have a relatively short term of
copyright, but I have not considered the subject sufficiently to be
justified in fixing any precise number of years.
</p>

<p>
But as to all copyrights it is my conviction that the interest of
the public unquestionably requires that they be granted for a
definite term of years, and that, if an extension is provided, the
extension should be for a fixed and definite time. It is only this
which enables the public to know, upon reading a notice of the
copyright, when the monopoly will terminate.
</p>

<p>
If for any reason it should seem wiser to make the term dependent
in its length upon the death of an author, then the continuance of
the copyright should depend upon definite evidence being filed in
the copyright office showing positively the date of death.
</p>

<p>
At the end of section 18, page 15, line 8, after "name," the words
"<i>Provided</i>, That in such published work the notice of
copyright be given as required in this act" should be inserted.
</p>

<p>
Section 19 should, in my opinion, be canceled. It is retroactive in
its character. Definite contracts have been entered into between
authors and the public with respect to matters already copyrighted,
and it would impair the obligations of those contracts to provide
any renewal or extension of such copyrights. It has already been
agreed between such authors and the public at what time their
copyrighted works shall pass into the public domain.
</p>

<p>
Recurring to lines 3 and 4 of page 15, I submit that they should be
canceled, so that the copyright shall extend for a definite number
of years after the date of original entry. There seems to be no
sound reason for giving an author a longer copyright, longer by a
year, if he makes his entry on the 2d of January, than another
author will have who enters his copyright on the 30th of December
preceding.
</p>

<p>
Section 21 should be canceled, as it gives, in effect, copyright
privileges where the conditions precedent required by this act have
not been performed.
</p>

<p>
Section 22, line 14, is too broadly worded for the benefit of the
authors of this bill, and the word "reproduction" should be
canceled and the words "copy or representation" should be inserted.
</p>

<p>
In lines 22 and 23 the words "such fraudulent" and the rest of the
section should be canceled, and the words "copies which are
infringements is hereby prohibited."
</p>

<p>
Section 23, paragraph (b), should be canceled and made to read:
</p>

<p>
"(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor damages for the
infringement."
</p>

<p>
As the paragraph now reads, it gives double damages. The proprietor
should receive damages which will be judicially ascertained in the
ordinary way, either by estimating the profits which the infringer
has made, or by estimating the damages or loss which the proprietor
has suffered. If there is no actual damage it should not be
provided that $250 should be recovered, and if the damages are
greater than $5,000 there is no sound reason for limiting them to
the latter sum.
</p>

<p>
For the same reasons lines 18 to 24 on page 17, and lines 1 to 7 on
page 18, should be canceled.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph (c) on page 18 should be amended by striking out the word
"alleged", in line 10, and inserting "shown to the satisfaction of
the court."
</p>

<p>
Section 25 should be amended by inserting at the end of line 23
"and with intent to deprive the owner of the copyright of lawful
profit."
</p>

<p>
The word "willfully" does not appear to make the section
sufficiently clear, and it is submitted that an infringer should
not be held guilty of a misdemeanor unless he have the intent
specified in the suggested amendment.
</p>

<p>
After line 6 on page 19 the following words should be inserted:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Provided</i>, That any person who performs the alleged
infringing acts under a mistake of fact or law shall not be deemed
to be a willful infringer."
</p>

<p>
The alleged infringer may have good reason to think that conditions
precedent have not been performed and that no valid copyright
exists; he may be under a mistake as to when the term expires; he
may be of the opinion that what he has produced is not a copy, and
he may perform his alleged infringing acts under advice of counsel.
It does not seem proper under such circumstances to hold him to be
a willful infringer and guilty of a misdemeanor.
</p>

<p>
In line 14 of page 19, after "knowingly," the following words
should be inserted: "and with fraudulent intent."
</p>

<p>
Page 20, line 9, before "publish," the following words should be
inserted: "send notice of such seizure by registered mail to the
person to whom the article seized is consigned or directed, and
shall."
</p>

<p>
Section 27, line 24, after "first," there should be inserted the
words "mailing or".
</p>

<p>
Section 29, lines 6 and 7, the words "supposed to contain" should
be canceled, and the words "which contains" should be inserted. It
is unreasonable to permit a postmaster to detain a package upon a
mere supposition.
</p>

<p>
In line 9, before "mail," there should be inserted the word
"registered."
</p>

<p>
Page 24, lines 16 and 17, the words "not more than one copy at one
time" should be canceled, and in line 17 the word "or" changed to
"and."
</p>

<p>
At the end of section 32 the following should be inserted:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Provided</i>, That the owner of the right to perform any
copyrighted work by means of any automatic mechanical device shall
not have the remedy by injunction herein provided until the amount
of fair and reasonable royalty for such use shall have been
ascertained by express contract between the parties, or by judgment
of a court, and shall be due and not paid."
</p>

<p>
Section 35, line 8, the word "full" should be canceled; and in line
9, after "allowed," there should be inserted "according to the
practice of law and equity."
</p>

<p>
In many cases it might be inequitable to allow costs, and the court
should be left free to exercise its legal discretion.
</p>

<p>
Section 36, line 11, the word "common" should be inserted before
the word "law." This section should be compared with section 2, and
they should be consolidated, or preferably they should both be
omitted as unnecessary and as being outside of the purview of this
act.
</p>

<p>
Section 38, line 23, there should be inserted after the word
"musical" the word "-dramatic."
</p>

<p>
Line 25, the word "make" should be canceled and there should be
inserted the words "produce by."
</p>

<p>
It is evident that the right to make belongs to the patentee of the
device.
</p>

<p>
Page 30, line 1, the words "ninety days" should be changed to
"three months" as more convenient and as excluding any contention
whether or not Sundays and holidays are included in the ninety
days. The similar provision of the patent law reads "three months."
</p>

<p>
Section 44 should be amended by inserting after "assignment", in
line 12, the words: "and index the same under the name of the
person by whom the original entry of copyright was made."
</p>

<p>
Section 45 should be amended so that lines 21 to 23 shall read as
follows: "signee shall in all cases give in the statutory notice of
copyright prescribed by this act the name of the person by whom the
original entry of the copyright was made."
</p>

<p>
Without this provision the public will be put to great
inconvenience in finding the original entry on which the copyright
depends. The copyright notice should be of a clear and specific
character so as to cause the public as little inconvenience and
uncertainty as possible.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 52 should be amended by striking out "provided" and all
thereafter to the end of the paragraph in lines 2 and 3 of page 33.
This provision is altogether too broad and the courts should be
left free to determine what are conditions precedent to a valid
copyright and whether there has been any breach of them.
</p>

<p>
Section 54 should be amended by striking out the words "the date of
the" and inserting "that the affidavit states the dates of;" and in
line 20 cancel the words "as stated in the said affidavit," and
insert the words "which dates shall be given in the certificate."
</p>

<p>
Section 55 provides for the destruction of card catalogues. The
wisdom of this provision is very doubtful. A single card catalogue
for each class of copyright work would save an immense amount of
time and error to the public, and to the Librarian in making
searches. Instead of periodically destroying card catalogues, they
should be added to and preserved. As soon as they are destroyed,
instead of being able to make one examination of one part of the
card catalogue, the public will be compelled to examine a great
number of periodically made printed indexes. I therefore suggest
that the words "and thereupon", to and including the word
"intervals," lines 9 to 12 of page 34, be canceled.
</p>

<p>
As to the destruction of articles provided for in section 59, I
suggest that the section be amended by inserting in line 10 of page
36, after the word "provided," the words "and with the
authorization of the Committees on Patents of the Senate and of the
House of Representatives."
</p>

<p>
Section 63 should be amended by striking out the words "sold or
placed on" in line 7, and by inserting "made public, or sold
publicly or privately, or placed on public."
</p>

<p>
As to section 64, I have to suggest that the present bill is
supposed to be what may be termed a codification of the copyright
law; if so, section 4966 of the Revised Statutes has no proper
place outside of this bill. If there is anything desirable in the
section it should be embodied in the bill at the proper place, and
in doing so it should be made plain that the word "musical" where
it first occurs in section 4966 means "musical-dramatic," meaning
thereby a composition which is dependent upon representation or
performance in the dramatic sense.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe that the people of this country are aware of what
the musical composers and publishers are attempting to do in the
way of securing monopolies.
</p>

<p>
If the public were aware that these persons, after having secured
copyrights giving them the exclusive right of copying and
publishing music for sale, and after having sold the copies of such
music are attempting to secure laws by which they may impose
further taxes upon the public for the use of such music by singing
or playing, and are seeking to provide fines and terms of
imprisonment for those members of the public who do not pay the
additional tax, there will be such a storm of protests before your
committees as could not be disregarded.
</p>

<p>
Section 4966 of the Revised Statutes should be repealed altogether,
and so far as its provisions appear in this bill they should be
limited to musical-dramatic compositions, and the provisions for
damages other than actual damages and for imprisonment should be
absolutely eliminated.

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. Now we will hear the gentleman who
represents the talking machines.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF S. T. CAMERON, ESQ., REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN GRAPHOPHONE
COMPANY, OF NEW YORK CITY.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Gentlemen, the first objection we have to the
bill is, in our mind, the most serious one, and one which has been
several times touched upon heretofore, so that I shall not attempt to
go into any very great detail in discussing it here, but shall simply
call attention to the fact that we object to it, and point out to you
why, in connection with our particular business, it is especially
important.
</p>

<p>
If you will turn to section 4 you will find that it reads:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That the works for which copyright may be secured under this act
shall include all the works of an author.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Our position is that this is in direct contravention of the
Constitution. If you will substitute in that clause the word used by
the Constitution, and say that the works for which copyright may be
secured under this act shall include all the "writings" of an author,
then we do not object to that section.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you will take certain other sections of this bill, with that
change made in section 4, and attempt to read them, particularly where
the word "reproduce" occurs, or the word "reproductions" occurs, you
will see the importance of it to us.
</p>

<p>
Take, for example, section 3, immediately above:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That the copyright provided by this act shall extend to and protect
all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted, any
and all reproductions or copies thereof.
</p>
</div>

<p>
If you read that word "reproductions" with the word "works" in section
4 changed to "writings," reproduction means a very different thing.
</p>

<p>
If you will turn to section 18, on page 14, subclause b, you will find
this language:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Any arrangement or reproduction in some new form of a musical
composition.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. What do you understand the word "works" to mean in
section 4?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. It may mean anything that is reduced to writing,
or that is not reduced to writing. It may be an oral speech that is
absolutely wafted upon the winds of the air and never gets into
permanent form. In proof of that we go to section 5, line 20: "Oral
lectures, sermons, addresses."
</p>

<p>
The talking-machine art stands in a somewhat different position from
that of the perforated music roll. You take a sheet of music and you
have Sousa's or any other band play that music into the horn of an
instrument, a patented apparatus. That machine engraves lines
corresponding to what? To the sound waves produced by the band or the
voice of the performer on the wax or other tablet.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you make that word "works" read "writings," as I understand, as
the Supreme Court has interpreted the word "writings," it means this,
in its broadest signification: That the idea of the author has been
recorded in some tangible form, in such a way that another, through the
eye, may have the idea of the author impressed upon his brain. That may
be a painting; it may be the work of an artist. I think the Supreme
Court has included a painting under that term because of that very
fact, that the idea of the artist was recorded in some tangible form
and, through the eye of the beholder, the idea of the artist was
conveyed to the brain of the beholder. That is what a writing is, as I
understand it, within the meaning of the Constitution.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. The effect of your argument is, then, to limit the
word to something that can be read by anybody?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Not necessarily by anybody.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. But by somebody?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Yes. I can not read Sanskrit.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I mean to say, that can be read by persons
understanding the same language?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Yes; something that is capable of conveying to
the reader, if you may call him such, the idea of the author.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. And in that respect it would cut out the
music-roll proposition altogether?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. As my predecessor has told you, there is a
dispute in regard to that, and I am not qualified to state. As far as I
have been able to analyze the evidence, the preponderance is against
the idea that the music roll can be read. But I do know this: There is
a graphophone record of the disk form [exhibiting record to the
committee]. There is a graphophone record of the cylinder form
[exhibiting record]. I defy anyone&mdash;I defy Mr. Sousa to read that and
tell whether it is one of his marches or whether it is a speech of a
Member of Congress. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. They are often very much alike. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. They are both musical. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. They are alike in volume of sound. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I am not making this statement theoretically nor
as a lawyer. I make it as an expert in this particular art. I have
spent months and months of time with the microscope myself striving to
do that very thing, and I know it can not be done.
</p>

<p>
Now, let us go one step further. What is it that makes that
graphophonic record valuable? I can take Mr. Sousa's score and I can
select some person, some alleged musician in this audience, and I can
hand him a graphophone and tell him to make that record, and it would
not be worth one cent upon the market. It takes the genius of a Sousa
to play into the horn. It takes the voice of the magnificent singer to
sing into the horn; and it takes the skill of the mechanician who is
operating the graphophone to make a fine record that has a marketable
value.
</p>

<p>
You ask me if I would use Sousa's march, make that record and sell it,
and not pay him any royalty. I answer, "Yes; I would;" because I have
paid him royalty. Whenever Mr. Sousa publishes one of his pieces of
music and puts it out upon the market and I pay the price of that
music, that sheet of music passes from under the monopoly, just as when
I patent a cornet and sell the cornet to Mr. Sousa, and he pays the
price for it, it passes out from under the patent monopoly, and he has
a right to use it. Suppose I should come here and say to you that every
time one of Mr. Sousa's cornet players played the cornet that I had
sold to him that he should pay me royalty for having played it! That is
what he is asking of you. That is not all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sousa himself does not scorn, as he pretended to the other day,
these "infernal talking machines." The day has been when Mr. Sousa
himself came with advance scores and begged to have them put upon the
machines, in order that they might popularize his own music. Nor is
that all. He to-day is under contract, and he plays into these
"infernal machines" with his band, and he is contributing, as he told
you a few days ago, to stifle these "beautiful young voices that now
have disappeared throughout our city and our land." [Laughter.] He does
it for the almighty dollar. That is what he is after, and he frankly
told you so.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I am honest, anyway. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. You are; and, as I said to you the other day, I
respect you for it. All the men urging this bill are not as honest as
you are, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. That is neither here nor there. We give them all
credit for being honest.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I would not have made that remark if I had not
been interrupted.
</p>

<p>
It was stated a moment ago, and it is a fact of which I wanted to
speak, that the intention here is to give everyone a fair show. The
gentleman here on my left (Mr. Webb) suggested that this bill would not
prohibit the perforated music rolls (and the same question would apply
to the graphophonic cylinder) from the reproduction of those pieces of
music or other copyrightable works which had appeared and been
copyrighted prior to this act. In that he is in error. Section 3 says:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Any and all reproductions, or copies thereof, in whatever form,
style, or size, and all matter reproduced therein in which
copyright is already subsisting.
</p>
</div>

<p>
So that it does not go only to matter that is copyrighted subsequent to
the passage of this act.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. I was speaking particularly of section g. That was
the section that the gentleman was objecting to, and I referred to that
particular portion.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. The act, however, would apply by reason of
section 3 to subsisting copyright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Yes; that may be so.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. There is a situation in the talking-machine art
that is perhaps divisible. You see two distinct forms of records. The
company which I represent&mdash;the American Graphophone Company&mdash;makes both
of those forms. There are a great many other companies, some of them
making the machines and the records, and some of them making only the
records. Some of them make the cylindrical form of record and some of
them make the disk form of record; but there are two large, prominent
companies, one of which makes the disk form of record and the other of
which makes the cylindrical form of record. As I say, the company which
I represent makes both.
</p>

<p>
Follow me now, if you please. There is also as close a musical trust,
as has already been said to you by my predecessor, in this country as
it is possible to form. That extends not only throughout this country,
but throughout the world. There are a few musical geniuses who are able
to stand above it and make them scramble for the genius. You have two
of them with you to-day, Victor Herbert and John Philip Sousa. But John
Philip Sousa can not speak for the struggling young composer who is not
powerful enough to compel this trust to come to him instead of the
young man going to the trust.
</p>

<p>
How does that effect us? Did you hear any opposition to this bill from
the attorney of the Victor Talking Machine Company? No. They make the
disk form of record. Have you heard any opposition from the National
Phonograph Works&mdash;the Edison Company&mdash;in regard to this bill? No. They
make the cylindrical form of record. Why does the Victor Talking
Machine Company come here with such a virtuous show of regard for the
author, and say they have no objection to this? Why is not the
representative of the Edison Company&mdash;the National Phonograph
Works&mdash;here opposing this bill? Because, as I charge, and I think I can
substantiate it before I get through&mdash;not here, but I mean before the
hearings before this committee are through&mdash;there is under way the same
iniquitous proceeding that was outlined to you by my predecessor in
connection with the music rolls.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. That is absolutely untrue, as far as the Victor
Talking Machine is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. You can have a chance to reply when your time
comes.
</p>

<p>
One company gets the exclusive right to make the disk form of record
from copyrighted music, and the other the exclusive right to make the
cylindrical form of record. Let us assume for a minute that what the
gentleman says is literally true. Let us assume, I say. Is it not
possible for just that combination to be made, and should the American
Graphophone Company, which has millions of dollars invested in the
enterprise, honestly and fairly built up under the laws of this
country, money put in and money which it had an absolute right to
presume the law would protect&mdash;should that company be placed in the
position where it should be practically driven out of business by any
such monopolistic combination? Will you gentlemen give them that
opportunity?
</p>

<p>
I am not prepared to say that this music publishers' combination is the
most gigantic trust on earth, but it is an absolutely close and
effective trust. You may reply that we have the right to play and put
upon these records all of the old noncopyrighted productions, those
that are now within the public domain. To that I reply that the
perforated music roll man or the talking machine man who attempts to
rely solely upon old music will go out of business inside of eighteen
months. He has got to meet the demand for the popular airs of the day.
He has got to be able to produce Sousa's and Victor Herbert's latest
productions. "I want what I want when I want it." That is where the
public stands. [Laughter.] You wait three years instead of fifty, and
where would we be?
</p>

<p>
Moreover, we go to Japan, we go to China, we go to the various
countries of the earth, and make these records&mdash;get the original
records. We do not make the original record on that disk. We do not
make it upon that cylinder. We make an original record from the voice
of the singer. That original record in the case of the cylinder is
first very carefully covered with plumbago, to render it electrically
conductive. It is then electroplated with copper; by applying cold, the
original record is shrunk out, and you then have a mold, which has on
its interior a perfect counterpart of the sound groove cut upon the
face of the original record. We pour into that mold melted wax, or a
composition that is called wax in the trade. When that is hot, it takes
the impression of the mold and retains that until it sets; and as it
cools it contracts, and we are then able to withdraw that from the
mold, and after trimming the ends, that reproduction, that copy, is as
perfect a record as the original one. If it were not so, we could not
make and sell a record for fifty cents when we have to pay the singer
from $500 to $1,000 or $3,000 for making the original record.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. I was going to ask, How do you get Mr. Sousa's
pieces? Do you pay him for it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. We do not; no, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Who does?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. The Victor Talking Machine Company has an
exclusive contract with Mr. Sousa, and he gets paid for that. He did
not tell you that the other day.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. That is absolutely untrue.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. If it is untrue I am ready to beg the gentleman's
pardon. I had that information direct this morning, but I will gladly
withdraw it upon Mr. Sousa's word&mdash;gladly. I do not want to make any
misstatement.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I have never received one penny for my compositions
from any kind of talking machine, nor have I ever made a contract with
any of those companies.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I did not state that. I stated that Mr. Sousa,
with his band, played into the horns of these instruments to make these
records and was paid for doing it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. An organization known as "Sousa and his band,"
employed just as any other body of musicians, in which I have no part
myself, plays into the instrument. That goes under arrangements made
with the management of that organization to play anybody's compositions
that these firms may elect; it may be a noncopyrighted piece or a
copyrighted piece, or anything else.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I am very glad Mr. Sousa stated that. He says
that he does not play his own music only, but his band stands ready to
play any other man's music, copyrighted or not copyrighted, into these
machines.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Not myself; no.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Latimer</span>. I want to ask a question of Mr. Sousa, so as
to clear the matter up a little further. The statement is that you have
a band that plays into these instruments, and you, I understand, have
denied that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. No, sir; I do not deny that "Sousa and his band,"
an organization known as "Sousa and his band," play for talking
machines.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Latimer</span>. Do I understand you to say that you have no
connection with that band?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I am the director of that band, but I have no
personal part in the performance of those pieces. I have never been in
the gramophone company's office in my life.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">McGavin</span>. Do you play for anyone else besides the Victor
Talking Machine Company?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. My manager has a contract with them for so many
performances.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Latimer</span>. You have an interest in the band and receive
profit from it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. Yes; surely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You allow your name to be used all over the country?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. In the performance of these pieces, certainly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. That was my charge.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. In regard to the untruth the gentleman has
stated&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Do you want to deny any statement that he has
made?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Yes. In regard to this, naturally it would be
inferred that it was the same case with me. In fact, he mentioned us
two together. A band played into these instruments, calling itself
"Victor Herbert's band," and I sued the talking machine company. That
is what I got out of the company.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. The gentleman misunderstood me. I have made no
statement in regard to him, and I have no information in regard to him
one way or the other.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. He made no charge against you, Mr. Herbert.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Since our names have been linked all the time, I
thought he intended what he said to apply to me also.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Pettit</span>. I would like to say to Mr. Cameron in regard to
his statement about the Victor Company and Mr. Sousa, that whenever we
have used Mr. Sousa's music, or rather whenever we used his band on
Victor records, we always paid him for it&mdash;that is, we pay Mr. Sousa
for playing.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Latimer</span>. I want to bring out one point in connection
with that. In making these records, if I understand, now, Mr. Sousa has
a band that represents him, playing these pieces, and you pay for that
music when you get it, or do you not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Whoever employed Mr. Sousa pays for it.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Latimer</span>. Then it is paid for when you get these
records?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I do not wish to be misunderstood. We can take
and do take one of Sousa's marches and have another band, with which
Mr. Sousa is not connected, play, and we make the record; and in that
case Mr. Sousa does not get any of the compensation whatever. None of
that goes to him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. But you do not advertise it as being played by
Sousa's band?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Not at all. We advertise it as Sousa's march.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You advertise it as a march by Sousa as a composer,
but played by somebody else as the executant?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Yes. That is recognized as such a valuable thing
to the composer, that John Philip Sousa has been to the office of the
American Graphophone Company, in years gone by, with advance scores,
and asked them to send them out, to advertise and help John Philip
Sousa along. He will not deny it. Moreover, we are flooded to-day with
artists that are struggling on the lower rounds of the ladder, that are
not as high up as John Philip Sousa was a few years ago, either,
begging us to do the same thing for them. I mention that to show you
that even John Philip Sousa, before he got where he bestrode the
musical world like a colossus, even he recognized the advertising value
of the talking machine to a composer. We are not doing him such a great
injury.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. I would like to say, Mr. Chairman, that the
gramophone, these talking machines, are really of very recent date. I
believe the gentleman will agree with me when I say that if we go back
fifteen years or sixteen years ago, we looked upon them purely as a
toy. I remember the first one I saw here in this city where I was born.
A gentleman had a man bark into it, and it was a remarkable thing to
hear this thing bark&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. I would suggest, Mr. Sousa, that you are
taking up this gentleman's time. Unless you want to specifically deny
something that he has said, or ask a question, it is hardly fair to
him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. If I ever did allow the Gramophone Company to do
it, it was because I did not think it was as important to them or to me
as I do now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Please do not confuse us with the Gramophone
Company. It is a different thing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Do you wish to deny that you are a musical
colossus? [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sousa</span>. No. I will admit that. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. One thing more in regard to the constitutional
question which I mentioned. I shall submit, or the company I represent
will submit, a written brief. You will be addressed on that point much
more ably than I can address you by Mr. Walker, who will succeed me.
</p>

<p>
I want, in closing, however, to emphasize one fact which my
predecessor, I understood, was told was unnecessary. With all deference
to the chairman, who said so, I disagree with him. That is the fact
that not only was the American Graphophone Company and the
talking-machine interests not notified, not only were these
conferences&mdash;quarterly conferences, we might call them, held in
secret&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I think you gentlemen had better all make it
clear, when you speak about these conferences, that you do not refer to
committees of Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. No, sir; we do not. We refer to these star
chamber proceedings, before this bill was introduced into Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. By whom? Not by anybody connected with the
Congress?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. By Herbert Putnam and the men he brought around
him. That is by whom.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I wanted it made clear that you were not
referring to any committees of Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. Every effort was made to keep us from knowing
that any such bill was under way. It was not merely an act of omission,
but it was an act of commission. That is not all. Not only were the
American Graphophone Company not notified, but, if you will turn to the
list of those present, you will find that one of those whom I have
mentioned here, the representative of the Victor Talking Machine
Company, at the third stage of the proceedings, was present&mdash;as what?
As one of the musical publishers of the country, representing the
Victor Talking Machine as one of the musical publishers of this
country. See how close the association is.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman who follows me will point out that association a little
closer. I think by that time the committee will realize that my
suggestion of a close cooperation between the National Phonograph
Works, the Victor Talking Machine Company, and the Musical Publishers'
Association is well founded.
</p>

<p>
I thank you.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, we will meet to-morrow morning at 10
o'clock to hear Mr. Walker.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. I represent the publishers and the composers. An
attack has been made here, and we feel that we should get at least
several minutes to answer the charges that have been made.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You will have some time to-morrow. We meet at 10
o'clock to hear Mr. Walker for an hour. After that you gentlemen will
have an opportunity to be heard, undoubtedly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I was to appear here to-day for the
manufacturers, in behalf of the talking machine interests, and was to
follow Mr. Cameron. If the chairman pleases, I should be very glad to
continue the first thing to-morrow morning, and let Mr. Walker follow.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. I could not consent to that, because I
understand that Mr. Walker has been notified that he will be heard the
first thing to-morrow morning.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I think Mr. Walker will agree to that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. It will be quite consistent with my convenience to
let this gentleman precede me for whatever time he wishes.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. How long would you want?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Probably fifteen minutes to half an hour.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. With that understanding, Mr. Walker, he will
precede you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes, sir. And I am to have an hour after that?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gentlemen</span>: On behalf of the Photographers' Copyright
League of America, having participated in the conferences called by
the Librarian of Congress upon the subject of a new copyright law,
we beg to say that we give our hearty assent to the principles of
the bill as proposed. Of course, there are minor matters which
might have been otherwise drafted by us, but we as cheerfully
surrender such particular items, as did many other interests
represented at the conference.
</p>

<p>
Copyright legislation has for its basic principle the protection of
the property of the copyright owner, and though remedies for damage
are manifestly necessary, prevention of injury is the matter of
highest importance to the copyright owner. Legislation which acts
as a deterrent is the active principle of protection prescribed by
the Constitution. For these reasons we believe the pending bill has
been framed upon logical and consistent lines which, if enacted
into legislation, will doubtless form precedent for other countries.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Herbert Putnam</span>, Esq.,
<br><i>Librarian of Congress</i>, <i>Washington, D.C.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>: Referring to the proposed bill to amend and
consolidate the act respecting copyright, a copy of which has been
handed me, with your circular letter regarding suggestions, I would
say that I would propose that the following clause be added
continuously to the end of section 3:
</p>

<p>
"<i>And provided</i>, That nothing herein contained shall apply to
sound records made or to be pressed from dies or matrices
manufactured prior to the passage of this act."
</p>

<p>
That the following be added to section 18, paragraph (<i>b</i>),
line 7, of said paragraph, between the word "composition" and the
word "any," viz, "including any talking-machine record."
</p>

<p>
The amendment to section 3 is mainly designed to protect
talking-machine manufacturers who have invested very large sums of
money in records and in dies or matrices for pressing the same,
many of which contain musical compositions the notation of which
has been copyrighted, but which under existing laws these records
do not in any manner infringe. To now take away the right to use
these matrices and records, into which so much money has been put,
would be very unjust and inequitable and work a great hardship upon
the talking-machine manufacturers&mdash;that is, if my reading and
understanding of this bill is correct. This would tie up a very
large amount of capital, and place the talking-machine record
manufacturers at the mercy of the owners of subsisting copyrights.
</p>

<p>
The object of the amendment to section 18, paragraph (<i>b</i>), is
to relieve any doubt that records containing the characteristic
articulation of the human voice, or the characteristic
instrumentation by a performer, adapted for reproducing these
characteristic utterances and performances to the ear are intended
to be included as copyrightable matter under section 4 of this
bill.
</p>

<p>
I think there will be no question but that the particular
characteristic utterances of a singer, or recitationist, or of an
actor, or of an orator, or the particular instrumentation of a
pianist, or leader of an orchestra, etc., independent of the
composition itself, whether it is copyrighted or not, should be
equally entitled to protection, as a photograph or reproduction of
a work of art.
</p>

<p>
It matters not whether the subject-matter of the record is
otherwise copyrightable or not. If the piece played is copyrighted
as a musical composition, it can not be reproduced on a sound
record, in accordance with the bill, without the permission of the
composer. A Paderewski, however, may play the copyrighted
selection, and a record of his rendition of it, with all his
personality and individuality thrown into the piece, should be
entitled to a copyright on a sound record for reproducing purposes.
</p>

<p>
This is true also of the voice of a Caruso or a Melba singing
either a copyrighted or uncopyrighted piece. It is true also, as a
further illustration, of the recitation by Henry Irving of "Eugene
Aramas' Dream." What is here copyrighted in these records is the
individuality and personality of the rendition by the performer. It
is the picture of the voice, or of the instrumentation, as, for
instance, a copyrighted photograph is a picture of a person or
thing.
</p>

<p>
Should another performer play the same piece played by a Paderewski
the personality of Paderewski would be absolutely wanting, and the
same difference between the two performances of the same
composition would be in the respective sound records as would exist
at the actual performance of the respective pieces. The same
differences between Caruso's rendition of a selection from
Rigoletto and a concert hall singer's rendition of the same would
exist in the sound record and the reproduction therefrom as would
exist in the actual singing of the selection. This is true
regarding personality of every voice and instrumentation recorded.
</p>

<p>
So-called talking-machine records in this respect differ quite
materially from the mechanical organ and piano, for the reason that
a so-called talking-machine record is an exact record of all the
modulations, and all the characteristic articulations of the voice,
as well as of all the characteristics of an instrumentation. In
other words, it is an exact picture of all the merits and demerits
of the original, and the original is reproduced with an exactness
so that frequently, at a distance, in the present perfected state
of the art, the reproduction may very well be mistaken for the
original.
</p>

<p>
This record of the voice and instrumentation for sound reproducing
is an art which was not commercially available, or perfected, when
the earlier copyright laws were passed, and therefore were not
included. It is doubtless the intention of the framers of this bill
to include such sound records as copyrightable matter, but in order
to relieve the bill from any doubt it may properly be expressed in
this section as I suggest.
</p>

<p>
Hoping that this will meet with your approval, I remain,
</p>

<p>
Yours, very truly,

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Librarian of Congress</span>, <i>Washington, D.C.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>: We are in receipt of your favor of the 31st
ultimo, with copy of proposed copyright law. After careful
consideration the provisions of this law seem admirably suited to
the purposes, and its framers deserve great commendation.
</p>

<p>
As circumstances do not permit my attendance at the hearings, I
would consider it a favor if you would read this letter to the
committee, if not all of it, then the portions which may not be
referred to at the hearing, should anything herein referred to fail
to be considered. The latter paragraphs of the letter are
especially brought to your attention.
</p>

<p>
In section 1, subdivision C, provision is made for the protection
of an "oral delivery" which has been prepared. Would it not be well
to specifically allow a speaker to announce at the conclusion of an
extemporaneous address his intention of copyrighting it, not
permitting this announcement, however, to interfere with the
liberty of the press in reporting portions of it?
</p>

<p>
Section 9 directs that notice of copyright shall be given at each
public delivery of a lecture or similar work. Does "similar work"
include dramatic composition? Is the proposed notice to be given
orally, or by publication on a programme, if there is a programme?
It would seem that in the case of a dramatic composition theatrical
managers should be compelled by law to print on each programme
copyright notice of the play or plays produced, being allowed,
where there is no programme, to announce it orally.
</p>

<p>
It would also seem important that in the case of a dramatic
composition publicly acted in foreign countries notice of copyright
in the United States, together with legal title of the work in
English, be printed on the programmes, as well as on the manuscript
copies of the play. This would serve as a notice against
translators, who otherwise would have great difficulty in finding
out whether a foreign play had been copyrighted here, since the
name of the play or its English equivalent rather, would be very
uncertain. Does the new law specifically require all titles to be
also in English?
</p>

<p>
Does the law provide for the registration of the title in advance
of the deposit of copies as at present&mdash;a valuable privilege?
</p>

<p>
Section 20 seems calculated to work an injustice to novelists. That
the author's exclusive right to dramatize his copyrighted work
should cease in the event of his being unable within ten years to
induce managers to produce his dramatization would be
unfair&mdash;would, in fact, encourage producers to wait until after ten
years before producing a dramatization of a novel. Would it not be
sufficient to state that the exclusive right terminates at the end
of ten years provided the author does not file at least an
unpublished dramatized version?
</p>

<p>
Does this section 20 mean that a foreign dramatist who deposits an
unpublished and untranslated copy of a dramatic composition loses
his rights if his play is not produced publicly in ten years, or
does it allow him to deposit a translated unpublished copy any time
within ten years, in order to protect his rights?
</p>

<p>
Section 45 might be profitably augmented by including the privilege
of allowing an author who writes under a pen name to print the
notice of copyright also under the same pen name. This would be a
considerable privilege, since at present he must go through the
complicated process of assigning his copyright to another if he
does not wish his real name to appear. In his claim for copyright
he could state both his real name and his pen name in which he
wished the copyright to appear. This would work injustice to no one
and would be a great convenience to authors whose real names are of
an uninspiring nature.
</p>

<p>
This section 45 might also contain a provision allowing an author
to change the title of an unpublished work without deposit for
further copies, provided he paid a fee, since almost every
unpublished play is renamed. The duplication of copies of the same
work under different titles is of no service to the copyright
office and is frequently an expense to authors. The production of a
play under any other than its copyrighted title should invalidate
the copyright.
</p>

<p>
The requirement of section 60, raising the copyright fee from 50
cents to $1, will work a real hardship to many writers,
particularly those who write short plays for vaudeville and have a
hard time to make a living, to those who write many plays without
ever securing any returns, and to the writers of words of songs,
whose work is apt to be stolen unless copyrighted and who receive a
very small compensation in any event, as a rule. We would strongly
recommend that for unpublished works and short articles in
periodicals especially copyrighted and for photographs the fee be
held at 50 cents, or even reduced to 25 cents.
</p>

<p>
Upon the enactment of the new law the copyright office will receive
from the dramatic writers a great many more works than are at
present offered, owing to the unsatisfactory condition of the
existing law. The number of dramatic compositions offered will also
be greatly increased by the favorable fact of the omission on the
notice of copyright of the year. At present the author of an
unpublished play must state the year of his copyright on his
title-page, and as it is often ten years or more after a play is
written before it secures a production, this telltale date proves a
great drawback in submitting the play to managers, and therefore
many authors prefer to run the risk of losing their plays rather
than to affix this hall-mark of antiquity. The prospect of this
increased revenue should be sufficient to induce the makers of the
law to reduce the copyright fee on unpublished works.
</p>

<p>
I should recommend also that a specific clause be added making it a
misdemeanor to copy from an unpublished manuscript any portion
without authority, or to be found in the possession of an
unpublished copyrighted manuscript or parts thereof without
authority. This would correct two grave abuses, one, the stealing
of an author's ideas and dialogue by a manager to whom the play
might be submitted, and the second, the stealing of manuscripts
after a play is produced. One bureau openly advertises and
continually sells for a few dollars manuscripts of produced plays,
and the sale of such manuscripts enables infringers to deprive
authors of great sums in royalties. The adoption of such a section
as this will, of course, be sharply contested, but there is
absolutely nothing inequitable in it for any person not intending
fraud.
</p>

<p>
It might also be well to deny the privilege of copyright to authors
who allow their plays to be publicly performed without first
securing a copyright.
</p>

<p>
I trust that none of these suggestions will be taken as a criticism
of the proposed law, which will confer great benefits upon and will
greatly stimulate native art, but I am confident that the
importance of some of the proposed additions and the convenience of
others will at once be seen.
</p>

<p>
Allow me to thank you for your courtesy in sending us the copy of
the proposed law, and to request the favor of any further matter
which the copyright office may have to issue upon the subject.

<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>: On behalf of a number of clients, who are interested
in the new copyright bill, we respectfully beg to suggest that in
order fully to carry out the broad purpose of the framers of the
bill, the bill should be amended substantially as shown in the
accompanying draft amendment.
</p>

<p>
The bill as it now stands does not provide for the registration, by
means of one entry, of a great many works of literature or art
which from necessity are printed on detached sheets.
</p>

<p>
Section 60 of the bill provides that several volumes of the same
book or a series of photographs, drawings, etc., relating to the
same subject&mdash;with variances only in pose or composition&mdash;may be
registered for one fee. But a connected series of instruction
carded for educational use, a series of color prints to be used on
toy building blocks, sliced animals, games of authors, and other
card games are protected. There is no doubt that a new game, such
as pit, flinch, etc., should be copyrightable as a unit, whether
with or without rules for instruction, in such a manner that all
the artistic work and literary work may be fully covered by
copyright, although the items of the series are not physically
connected, and are not each provided with separate copyright
notice.
</p>

<p>
While the experts in charge of the bill may be able to phrase this
purpose in words more apt than those contained in the proposed
amendment, there is no doubt that it is the intention of the
framers of the bill to include the articles referred to in this
letter, and also that the bill as it now stands does not cover such
articles.
</p>

<p>
Respectfully,

<p>
Mr. Chairman, I ask leave to interpolate a word to the group of
interests adverse to these "musical-device" provisions of the bill. I
say it for the Government. And in order to avoid a syllable more
than is necessary I have written it.
</p>

<p>
The reasons, gentlemen, why your group was not invited to the
conferences were made plain in my opening statement. First, the
conference was a conference of associations, and your interests are
not organized into an association. But, second, the conference was to
be particularly of those interests concerned "in an affirmative way"&mdash;that
is, in amplifying the copyright protection; and your interests are
negative. We quite anticipated the issue raised by these provisions,
but it was not an issue which seemed appropriate to the conference
nor for other reasons one likely to be settled by the conference.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Thomae represented that his interests might in one aspect be
affirmative also and asked to hear the discussion. He was permitted to.
He was not invited; he did not participate; he uttered not a word in
the course of the entire proceedings. But he asked to come and listen,
and he was permitted to. On the list of the few others present as
observers you will find the name of Gen. Eugene Griffin. General
Griffin came to us in March saying that he understood some such
provisions as these were under consideration; he had some interest in a
concern which would be affected; could he attend the conference and
hear what was proposed? Certainly. And he did. Mr. Thomae was to us but
the maker of a particular typical device. With Mr. Thomae as a
competitor among you we had no concern. What device or company General
Griffin was interested in we did not know and I do not know to this
day. But we took care to insert the names of both gentlemen on the
printed list of those present, so that you and others might be free to
make such inference as you chose from the fact of their presence. And
this list was furnished freely to all requesting it.
</p>

<p>
These conferences have been going on for a year past. The fact that
they were being held, their purpose, and the associations participating
in them was freely published. Among these associations were the
composers and the music publishers. In the Apollo suit then pending
they were trying to secure protection of this sort under existing law.
There was every reason to suppose that they would urge it in the new
statute. Did any of you ever inquire of us whether they were doing so?
As long ago as last December the President announced to Congress, and
in the most public way to the country, that the bill had already been
prepared. Did you ask us for it? Did you even ask whether such a bill
would be likely to include any such provisions? As long ago as January
the music trade journals began to refer to the fact that it would do
so. Did you then ask leave to come to the next conference? Did you ask
even as to the character of the provisions? Did you communicate with
the Copyright Office in any way in the matter? You know you did not.
</p>

<p>
The fact that you did not is not to prejudice you in any way, and the
fact that you did not participate in the conferences I have myself
emphasized to the committee to your advantage, pointing out that these
provisions had been inserted without discussion at the conferences by
any interest naturally adverse to them. The fact is to your advantage.
I earnestly suggest that you avoid giving it a twist such as Mr.
Cameron gave it yesterday; I mean by such expression as "star chamber
proceedings." We can't let such imputations against the Government
stand uncorrected. But we hate to have to divert attention from the
main issue in order to correct them. The main issue is the merit of
these provisions. We are as anxious as is the committee to know your
substantial objections to them. And our interest is absolutely
identical with that of the committee in seeing that the objections you
show shall have due value and effect.

<p>
Messrs. <span class="sc">Chairmen</span>: In my remarks to the representatives of
the talking machine and perforated roll interests at the hearing of
June 9 I stated that Mr. Thomae had not been "invited" to the
conferences. Of course he was invited or he could not have
attended. What I meant was that he was not among those originally
invited or in our list of those naturally entitled to be present.
</p>

<p>
I had thought the distinction sufficiently clear from the context;
but I find that it was not.
</p>

<p>
The chief purpose of my reference to him and to General Griffin was
not, of course, to excuse or explain their presence, but to
indicate how readily access to the conference could be secured by a
request to the copyright office.
</p>

<p>
Very respectfully,

</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairmen of the Committees on<br>
Patents of the United States
Senate and House of Representatives</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I wish to say that last winter some time Mr.
Griffin, who is interested in one of the perforated-roll concerns,
called at the committee room and talked about this matter, and I
advised him at that time to see Mr. Solberg and Mr. Putnam. The
committee clerk has had some correspondence with him since that time,
and other gentlemen connected with that same business, I suppose, have
been into the committee room to make inquiries regarding this matter
pretty nearly every week for months.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I would like to say that I do not even know who
Mr. Griffin is.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. He is the vice-president of the General Electric
Company. I think he lives in Brooklyn and is connected with some
perforated-roll company.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>. I wish to point out that the remarks that I made
were in connection with the American Graphophone Company and the
automatic talking machine, and not the perforated-roll business. That
is the matter that is involved in these suits, not the talking
machines.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Mr. Griffin represents the Edison Company, and
they manufacture talking machines.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>. Mr. Griffin does not represent the Edison Company,
and he is a director of the Perforated Music Roll Company, who operated
under my patents. General Griffin is now in Europe, and this notice
which I referred to yesterday, in which I stated that notice was given
me that my license would be canceled in case this bill passed, came
from Mr. Henderson, the acting manager of the Perforated Music Roll
Company, on behalf of General Griffin and other directors.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Henderson notified me that the passage of this act would put them
out of business. He also stated to me that General Griffin had stated
to him that he attended these conferences, and that he considered them
logrolling proceedings, and that in time he would take action to oppose
them. But at present General Griffin is in Europe. I am sure, from his
remarks, that he would oppose this measure in the strongest possible
way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I have no doubt that he would. He gave me so to
understand.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I think it is due to this record to say that the
ultimate responsibility about this whole matter rests with Congress,
and that these matters are all simply advisory, to help us to the
proper conclusion and result, and that none of these gentlemen are
going to be deprived of an opportunity to express themselves in
whatever way they please, and to say whatever they may have to say, and
that, so far as we are concerned, there is no star-chamber proceeding
about it, and no logrolling business about it. We are here simply to
get advice the best we can, and therefore we shall undertake to hear
everybody.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Mr. Chaney is entirely right. The sentiments
that he has expressed have been freely stated by the committee during
the past three or four days that we have been in session. The
committees of the Senate and the House are willing, and will be
willing, to hear anyone who has objections to or who is in favor of
this bill at any time within any sort of reason. It seems to me that it
is to little purpose, so far as the committees are concerned, that
there should be any controversy between anyone regarding the past. Who
is the next witness?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I might say that it was for that reason that both
committees decided to make no effort to report this bill at this
session, but to let it go over until next winter, in order that people
could have an opportunity during vacation to file briefs and such
statements as they might desire to offer.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. That is the precise purpose of the statement
made by Mr. Currier in behalf of the House committee at the first
session or the second, and by myself in behalf of the Senate committee.
</p>

<p>
Who is the gentleman that desires to be heard further?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Cromelin.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You have how many minutes?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I understand that I have half an hour.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You were limited, two days ago, to one hour for
your enterprises. Mr. O'Connell had a little over an hour, and I am
told that after I was compelled to leave for the Senate yesterday
somebody representing these interests had fifteen minutes. We will give
you fifteen minutes, with the privilege of submitting in writing any
further statement that you desire to make.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It is necessary to do that, for the reason that
two gentlemen are on the way here from Chicago who want to be heard
this morning, representing the same interests that you represent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Serven</span>. I present, Mr. Chairman, a letter from the
chairman of the copyright committee of the Music Publishers'
Association, explaining how Mr. Thomae, who was criticised yesterday as
being one of their delegates, came to have a seat with them in the
conferences. It occurred to me that it would save time to have it read
for the information of these gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You may put it in the record.
</p>

<p>
(The letter referred to is as follows:)
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
The <span class="sc">Chairman of the Joint Senate and House Committees on Patents</span>.
<br><i>Washington, D.C.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>: I beg to make reply to an accusation against the
Music Publishers' Association of the United States yesterday by the
manufacturers of mechanical perforated music rolls, cylinders, and
disks, in which they claimed our association had corralled into its
ranks, by promise and contracts, the Victor Talking Machine
Company, of Camden, N.J. They further claimed that the Librarian
of Congress had made no attempt to seek them out and give them
representation at the various conferences he had called for the
purpose of securing suggestions from organizations of authors,
composers, and others interested in receiving copyright protection
for their productions.
</p>

<p>
I beg to state that the copyright department during the interim
between the first and second conferences conferred with me and
asked if the talking machine and music roll manufacturers had an
organization. I replied that I did not know but would inquire about
it. About that time I met Mr. R. L. Thomae, a representative of the
Victor Talking Machine Company, who had just drafted a bill with
the view of presenting it to Congress, for protection on musical
compositions for which his company had secured the right, having
expended about $35,000 for well-known artists who had sung in the
records for them. They wanted protection from the pirates in their
own business from copying such valuable subjects. As a result of
our talk Mr. Thomae decided to drop the bill and secure protection
in the new copyright draft which was then being formulated.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Thomae and myself made a trip to Washington, called on the
copyright department, and it was agreed, in view of the fact that
the talking machine people had no organization, that the delegates
from the Music Publishers' Association should be increased from two
to three, provided the third member was some representative of the
talking-machine interests. After conferring with the president of
the association it was decided to do this, and Mr. Thomae was
selected as such representative. We believe that the talking
machine people should have as good protection as ourselves on their
original or characteristic works embodying the personalities and
instrumentation of their artists, bands, orchestras, etc., employed
by them.
</p>

<p>
We hereby declare that the Victor Talking Machine Company has no
contracts of any kind whatsoever with any member of the Music
Publishers' Association of the United States in regard to any
future purchase for use of compositions belonging to us. This
statement will explain in detail how the Victor Talking Machine
Company came to be associated with the Music Publishers'
Association in the copyright conferences held to aid in drafting
the bill here under consideration. All statements to the contrary
are not substantiated by the facts.
</p>

<p>
On behalf of the Music Publishers' Association of the United
States, whose list of members is attached, I beg to remain,
</p>

<p>
Sincerely, yours,

<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF PAUL H. CROMELIN, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Before proceeding, I would like to make this
point clear: That Mr. O'Connell yesterday, in appearing before
your committee, was representing the perforated-roll interests. I
represent the talking-machine interests, which means more in dollar
capitalization than the perforated-roll interests. I trust, while I
shall endeavor to finish my remarks in fifteen or twenty minutes, that
if General Walker is willing, you will extend my time to half an hour.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We are compelled to limit you absolutely to
fifteen minutes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Very well, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, on behalf of the Columbia
Phonograph Company and the Columbia Phonograph Company, General, sole
sales agents for the American Graphophone Company, I protest against
those portions of the proposed copyright law by which it is proposed to
extend the copyright protection to reproductions to the ear, so as to
include under the term "writings," as this term is used in the
Constitution of the United States in the protection of authors and
composers in their writings, mechanical or other reproductions to the
ear; and, in particular, in so far as this bill may be construed to
cover talking machine sound records in any form soever.
</p>

<p>
In view of the fact that you are going to limit me to fifteen minutes,
I think it best that I should state specifically my reasons for
opposing this bill, and I have put them down in writing. I have fifteen
specific reasons, and I would request that during the time I am stating
these reasons I shall not be interrupted. I invite the committee at the
conclusion of my statement of these specific reasons to ask any
questions they wish, and I request permission to appear before the
committees at some future time, during the recess of Congress, to
explain in detail all the statements that are made. Without attempting
to elucidate, gentlemen:
</p>

<p>
First. We protest that such legislation, in so far as it relates to
talking machine sound records of any kind, is unconstitutional.
</p>

<p>
Second. That such legislation is against public policy and directly
contrary to the spirit and progress of the times.
</p>

<p>
Third. That the demand for such legislation does not emanate from the
great mass of the musical authors (composers), nor is it demanded by
them, but has been conceived by certain selfish individuals who have
conspired together to form and create a giant monopoly, the like of
which the world has never known.
</p>

<p>
Fourth. That such legislation, instead of being in the interest of the
composers, is directly opposed to their real interest, which is to have
the greatest possible distribution of such records as the best means
for creating a demand for their sheet music. Abundant evidence can be
furnished to sustain this fact, if desired.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It is desired.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Fifth. That it is class legislation in the
interests of the few as opposed to the enjoyment and happiness of the
masses, whose rights seem regularly to have been lost sight of during
its preparation, and that it is particularly vicious when the rights of
the poor are considered.
</p>

<p>
Sixth. That in so far as the question of copyright must of necessity be
viewed from an international standpoint, it is inadmissible,
intolerable, and distinctly un-American to grant to foreign composers
the right to extract toll from every American citizen where such right
is denied such foreigner at home in his own land and is denied to
American composers abroad.
</p>

<p>
I hope during the recess to explain my connection with this matter. I
was the representative of my company in Berlin, Germany, for four
years, and had occasion to appear in this very matter; and I want to
warn you gentlemen against what happened there. I trust that freedom
will be given to all mechanical musical instruments and that no Æolian
monopoly will be able to tack on a provision which will give them
perforated-roll rights and exclusive rights. I propose to show that
this monopoly is not of a national character, but the attempt to create
it is an international conspiracy.
</p>

<p>
Seventh. That such legislation is directly contrary to all recent
legislation in foreign countries, the most important of which is the
act of the German Reichstag in 1901, by which perfect freedom is given
to use copyrighted works for the purpose of mechanical reproduction;
and by which, by reason of an interpretation announced by the minister
of justice prior to the third reading of the bill, the right to record
and reproduce any copyrighted work by means of talking machines was
expressly permitted.
</p>

<p>
Eighth. That such legislation is contrary to the spirit of the Berne
convention.
</p>

<p>
Ninth. That in no other country is substantially like protection
afforded to composers, but that such protection has been universally
denied.
</p>

<p>
Tenth. That even if such rights were granted under the laws of Great
Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, and other countries, which they are
not, it is beyond the power of Congress to do other than that which it
is expressly permitted to do under our Constitution, and the only way
by which such a law could be enacted which would stand the test of the
highest court of judicial inquiry would be by an amendment to the
Constitution of the United States. On behalf of my company, I protest
against being plunged into such long and expensive litigation as would
necessarily ensue if this bill becomes a law, unless the necessity for
the same is urgent, and this I emphatically deny.
</p>

<p>
Eleventh. That such legislation is in direct contradiction to all
recent judicial decisions on the subject in this country and abroad in
which common law rights and statutory rights of authors and composers,
their scope, extent, intent, and purpose have been discussed, the most
noted of which in this country is the decision handed down by the
United States circuit court of appeals, second circuit, during the last
week of May, in the Æolian suit against the Apollo Company, Judges
Lacombe, Townsend, and Coxe, without a dissenting voice, approving and
upholding Judge Hazel's opinion rendered in the court below sustaining
the contention that the perforated roll is not a violation of the
copyright, and it is interesting to note that the court went out of its
way to say:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The argument that because the roll is a notation or record of the
music it is, therefore, a copy would apply to the disks of the
phonograph <span class="asterisk">* * *</span> which it must be admitted is not a copy of the
sheet music.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In England the same position is taken by the courts, the leading and
most recent case being Boosey <i>v.</i> Whight, in which it was clearly
held that the perforated roll was not a violation of the copyright. In
Belgium, by decree of the fourth chamber of the court of appeals in
Brussels, December 29, 1905, in the case of Massenet and Puccini,
composers, <i>v.</i> Ullman &amp; Co. and Pathe Fr&egrave;res, manufacturers, in
dismissing the suit, with costs, the court uses this language&mdash;I want
to say to you, gentlemen, that this was a graphophone case:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Considering that these apparatus can not be assimilated to the
writing, or the notation by an engraving process, of the thoughts
of the author; that they have nothing in common with the
conventional signs permitting reading or comprehension of the work
to which they are related; that isolated from the rest of the
instrument they remain in the actual state of human knowledge,
without any utility, that they are only one organ of an instrument
of execution.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In dismissing the suit the court referred to a similar suit decided in
France February 1, 1905, in which it was confirmed that&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
airs of music on disks or cylinders of graphophones and gramophones
do not constitute a musical infringement.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Twelfth. That the proposed legislation in so far as relates to
mechanical reproductions is in furtherance of the plans of certain
powerful interests to obtain a monopoly&mdash;an international monopoly&mdash;on
mechanical reproducing instruments of all kinds, and that they are
attempting to use the legislative branch of the Government to secure
that which has been repeatedly denied them by the courts.
</p>

<p>
Thirteenth. That it is vicious, in that if it is permitted to be
enacted into law it will deal a deathblow to great American industries
which have been extended until now they embrace all countries, and in
which millions of dollars have been invested in the knowledge that the
right to manufacture was perfectly lawful and that the right to
continue such manufacture, unhampered by such ruinous conditions as
would be imposed by this bill, could never be brought into question or
become the subject of serious dispute.
</p>

<p>
Fourteenth. That if this bill becomes a law it will seriously affect
the rights of thousands upon thousands of American citizens who have
purchased these machines and who have the right to expect to continue
to use them and to obtain the supplies for them at reasonable prices
instead of paying tribute to a grasping monopoly.
</p>

<p>
Fifteenth. And finally, that whatever arguments may be advanced by the
association of musical publishers (and their allied interests, whose
representatives framed the bill, and who, if it becomes a law, will get
99 per cent of the benefits to be derived therefrom), regarding other
methods of mechanically producing sound on the theory that the same
constitutes a method or system of notation and under certain conditions
may be read by persons skilled in the art, under no circumstances can
such arguments be truthfully advanced to cover or apply to talking
machine sound records.
</p>

<p>
No man living has ever been able to take a talking-machine record and
by examining it microscopically or otherwise state what said record
contains. In this sense it stands preeminently in a class by itself,
being unlike perforated rolls, cylinders containing pins, metal sheets,
and other devices used in mechanical production of sound, and is not to
be likened in any manner to the raised characters used in methods of
printing for the blind, where by the sense of touch the meaning is
intended to be conveyed. The sense of touch is a mere incident due to
the disability of the blind, but it is perfectly feasible and easy to
read the characters with the eye, and they are very properly the
subject of copyright. I repeat, that to attempt to decipher a
phonograph disk is in the very nature of the proceeding "reaching for
the impossible." How utterly preposterous and ridiculous it would be to
pass this act in its present shape, which would make a telegraphonic
sound record, which is something that can not even be seen&mdash;the record
itself being caused by the magnetization and demagnetization of an
electric current of an ordinary piece of wire or a cylinder or disk of
steel&mdash;a violation of the copyright laws.
</p>

<p>
You have seen several examples, gentlemen, of methods of reproducing
sound. Mr. Cameron showed you yesterday the disk form of
talking-machine record. [Exhibiting disk.] That record, if you were to
examine it under a microscope, is an engraving of the sound, which is
produced by a method wherein the sound waves are engraved laterally at
a uniform depth.
</p>

<p>
Another form is the cylindrical record. Mark you, gentlemen, our
company is the only one on earth that manufactures both forms. We are
vitally interested in this legislation. In the cylindrical record the
cut is of uneven depth. It is an up-and-down cut.
</p>

<p>
There are other methods, and one or the most important discoveries of
the age&mdash;a discovery which was considered of so much importance that at
the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 it was given great prominence in the
Government exhibits&mdash;is the telegraphone.
</p>

<p>
I have here a record [exhibiting record] and I would like to ask Mr.
John Philip Sousa if he can recognize "The Stars and Stripes forever"
upon it. I would like Mr. Bowker, who stood up yesterday and said that
he could read the music roll&mdash;which I emphatically deny&mdash;whether he
recognizes an address of Mr. Victor Herbert upon this form of record
[exhibiting record]?
</p>

<p>
I doubt very much whether these persons who have come down here for the
purpose of putting through this legislation have ever seen this thing.
They do not know what it is, even. That is the sound record. I do not
know what it is. Nobody knows what it is until you put it on the
machine. Yet it can be reproduced indefinitely, and it can be destroyed
by that peculiar power which we know not, because no one knows at the
present time what electricity is. I want to tell you what you are
doing: When you pass this bill and make it a law, you make that piece
of steel copyrightable [indicating]. You make this record spring
copyrightable. You do not see anything on it. Look at it closely. There
is nothing but a magnetic current&mdash;an electric current&mdash;by which the
sound is actually recorded and can be reproduced indefinitely. I
regret, gentlemen, that I am not able to show you; and I hope at the
sessions of Congress, or during the recess, to personally demonstrate
what I am bringing to your notice this morning.
</p>

<p>
There is one other point I would like to bring to the attention of you
gentlemen, and that is this: That in the cylindrical form of talking
machine it is not necessary for the manufacturer to make the roll. In
every other mechanical instrument which has been referred to here the
process is a factory process; but, as I am speaking, the very words
that I am uttering are being taken down by Mr. Hanna, and in less time
than an hour these words will be transferred to a graphophonic record;
and by that means to-morrow morning you will get your printed record.
For fifteen years the reports of the House of Representatives and the
Senate of the United States have been prepared in this manner. And now,
when you make this bill a law I can not, notwithstanding the fact that
I have purchased a piece of music of Mr. Herbert, take that which I
have purchased and sing it into my machine at all. It is impossible to
do so. I wish to draw this fine distinction, and show you that in the
cylindrical form of talking machine it is not a mechanical operation
which is done in a factory, but that it is an instantaneous form of
photographing the voice. I would like to have a notation made of that.
</p>

<p>
You have limited me as to time, but before closing I want to show you
what the practical operation of this bill would mean.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Your time has expired.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. May I have just one moment?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You may have one minute more.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I would like to show you the point of the
multiplicity of royalties. Under this law I go down to John F. Ellis's
and buy a sheet of music composed by Mr. Victor Herbert. I pay the
royalty at the time that I buy that music. I am a singer and I want to
sing it. I go to a talking-machine company; but no, I do not dare. I
must seek Mr. Herbert. And he says: "You are going to make a big sum on
it, and you must pay me $25." I pay him $25, and I go to the
talking-machine company and the company does not dare to proceed. They
must first seek Mr. Herbert. Mr. Herbert says: "You are going to make a
lot of money out of this; I want $100 before you can make the record."
We pay that for the record.
</p>

<p>
I do not know when I get the record whether I am going to get a thing.
It goes through a factory process, which costs me another hundred
dollars, and then the record is made. I am about to announce the record
to the people of the United States, and to give them the privilege of
hearing it. What happens? No; I do not dare to do it. Every American
has to pay tribute to Mr. Herbert. Before I can sell those records Mr.
Herbert must get a royalty of 10 per cent on every one of them. I do
not believe it is the meaning of the Constitution to do this.
</p>

<p>
Let us go one step further. At a recent banquet in Portland, Oreg., of
the "Ad. Men's Association," by arrangement with the telephone company,
over the seat of every person who participated in that banquet there
was a little horn attached to the telephone, and there was a Columbia
graphophone at the central office. But if this bill becomes a law the
telephone company would not dare do that. They would not dare give the
people in the country the privilege of an evening's entertainment,
where they can not get to the big cities, without first arranging with
Mr. Herbert. Mr. Herbert would say: "No; you can not do this. I want a
hundred dollars' profit before you do that." After you have done it,
everybody who pays a toll of 5 cents for an evening's entertainment to
the telephone company pays its tribute to Mr. Herbert. I do not believe
that that is the intention of you gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
I regret that I am so much limited as to time, and I hope to appear
before you during the summer session, as I believe that I can throw
some new light on the situation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. You gentlemen speak of the committee holding
sessions during the summer season. The House has no such authority. The
members of the House are likely to have a very busy season, and it will
be impossible to get the House committee here during the summer. But
the House committee will be here on the first Monday in December, ready
to hear you gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I thank you very much for your attention.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. In the statement that you submit I would like to
have you make it specific as to which sections you object to, and make
your argument apply to those sections.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. I shall be glad to do that.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. And let it follow your remarks in the record?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF ALBERT H. WALKER, ESQ., OF NEW YORK.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Gentlemen of the committee, I sincerely thank you
for the compliment implied in giving me an hour in which to express my
views upon this bill. The allowance is liberal, and it will not be
extended except at the request of the committee. My hour will be an
hour of sixty minutes, and my remarks will end at twenty minutes before
12, if they end in the middle of a sentence.
</p>

<p>
I do not appear in behalf of any particular interest, although I have
one client which is interested in one section of the bill. I do not
propose, however, to address myself particularly to the interests of
that client. I do propose to address myself to the bill as a whole.
</p>

<p>
I think that the gentlemen who prepared this bill are to be thanked by
the committee, and by the people of the United States, and by everybody
else, for the large amount of labor which they have devoted to the
preparation of that proposition for legislation. I particularly desire
to express my personal appreciation of the labors of Mr. Putnam&mdash;his
entirely disinterested and very skillful labors in the preparation of
the bill.
</p>

<p>
We have had copyright laws in this country now for exactly one hundred
and sixteen years, and none of them have been scientific; none of them
have been systematic; none of them have been well developed. It is high
time that the whole system of legislation upon the subject should be
put upon a scientific basis and should be developed in a scientific
form. This bill is a sincere attempt to accomplish that result. It
contains a number of provisions which I heartily approve. It contains
much that I think ought to be amended. I trust that out of this bill,
and before the end of the present Congress, a bill will be evolved
which will be enacted into law, and which will be just as to all
parties and of very much benefit to the American people, and of benefit
to the composers and the authors, who are the particular subjects of
the bill. I believe, however, that before that result is accomplished
extensive amendments must be made in this bill.
</p>

<p>
I am going to devote the first ten minutes of my time to stating the
principles upon which I think those amendments ought to be framed, and
after that I am going to apply those principles to portions of the
bill, to show what changes would result from the application of those
principles to the bill. In order to say what I intend to say on the
subject of principles, it will be necessary for me to indulge in a few
moments of historical statement.
</p>

<p>
When the scholar looks over the civilizations of history, he finds only
one principle that pervades them all, and that principle is the
principle and idea of the continuity of private property. China,
Greece, Rome, Babylon, Nineveh, Judea, Egypt, England, Germany, Russia,
the United States are all pervaded, as Japan is, by the notion of the
continuity of private property. And when I speak of the continuity of
private property I mean its continuous continuity, its hereditable
character, its passing down from father to son, from age to age, and
from generation to generation.
</p>

<p>
My good friends Victor Herbert and John Philip Sousa, men whom I
respect personally as well as professionally, are basing their desire
for the passage of this bill upon the notion which they have that that
idea of the continuity of private property inheres in their
intellectual productions; and there is exactly where my brothers are
mistaken.
</p>

<p>
I am myself an author. I am an author of books and writings. A hundred
of them probably have been published. I am the author of a very large
number of addresses, which have been delivered without writing, on
religious, historical, economic, legal, scientific, and miscellaneous
subjects; but I know, as well as I know any proposition in history or
in law, that I have not any element of private property in any of those
intellectual productions, in the sense in which I am defining private
property, namely, with the idea of continuity.
</p>

<p>
Why is that so? It is so because from the foundation of the world until
now there never was a nation and there never was a day when the idea of
the continuity of private property was connected in the minds of men
with intellectual productions. England has developed the idea of
private property more fully than has any other nation; and England
never ascribed the idea of the continuity of private property to any
intellectual production, either for an invention or for a writing. To
this day no man has a right in England to a patent on an invention, and
never has had. The granting of any patent on an invention in England is
dependent entirely upon the pleasure of Edward the Seventh; and the
patents themselves, when granted, each one of them sets forth that
fact, and states that Edward the Seventh thinks on the whole that it
will benefit the realm to grant this patent, and proceeds to grant it.
But if Edward the Seventh and those who represent him choose to decline
to issue a patent in pursuance of any particular application they can
do so in entire conformity with the laws of England.
</p>

<p>
In respect to the protection of private property relevant to
intellectual productions in the domain of books or musical
compositions, this is the history in England: Prior to the time of
Milton nobody had a right to publish anything in England without the
permission of the Crown, and that permission was granted or refused,
not with reference to the deserts or the merits of the author or the
composer, but with reference to the opinion of the Crown as to whether
or not the published thing would be beneficial or not beneficial to the
public interests. And the Crown usually identified the public interests
with the interests of the Crown, so that it suppressed what it desired
to suppress and permitted to fly what it desired to be published.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the Commonwealth publication became free and was free,
but there was still no notion of any exclusive right to publish a
particular literary or musical composition inhering in the author of
that composition; and that right never did begin and never was heard of
in England until the reign of Anne, when Parliament passed a statute
establishing such a right for a limited time.
</p>

<p>
In 1769 a copyright which had been issued under the statute of Anne had
expired, and the owner of that copyright determined to test the
question in the English courts as to whether or not there was a
perpetual right of copyright under the common law of England,
regardless of the statute of Anne, and the owners of that copyright
brought suit for its infringement after the term established by the
statute of Anne had expired; and the question whether such a common-law
right existed or not came before the court of king's bench when Lord
Mansfield was chief justice of that court. The court of king's bench
decided, as an academic proposition, that there had been anciently an
exclusive right to an intellectual production under the laws of
England. That was, however, a purely speculative statement. They could
not point to the time when anybody asserted any such right or to an
instance when anybody had acquiesced in it. They simply took the
ground, as an academic proposition, that anciently there had been such
a right. They also decided, however, that whether that right existed or
not, it had been ended by the statute of Anne, and that the statute of
Anne circumscribed the right to the limited time provided for by that
statute.
</p>

<p>
From that decision or the court of king's bench the plaintiff appealed
to the House of Lords, sitting in its judicial capacity. We sometimes
have the notion that when the House of Lords sits in its judicial
capacity all the peers of the Realm&mdash;500 in number&mdash;assemble together
and hear the arguments and render a final decision, but it is not so.
Only the law lords participate; and if an ordinary nobleman should
venture to sit when the House of Lords was sitting in its judicial
capacity he would be hooted out of the room, and his presence would be
made to appear to him to be extremely unwelcome. The number of law
lords that sat at the time of the hearing of that argument was 11, and
6 of them rendered the opinion that the statute of Anne was the only
foundation known to the law of England for exclusive right to an
intellectual production, and that therefore the plaintiff was not
entitled to recover.
</p>

<p>
That was the situation of the laws of England at the time of the
foundation of our Union, at the time of the Declaration of
Independence, and at the time of the framing of our Constitution. In
1787 our Constitution was framed, and the fathers inserted in that
Constitution this provision:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The Congress shall have power to promote the progress of science
and the useful arts by securing, for limited times, to authors and
inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That is the only foundation that exists for the patent laws of the
United States, and it is the only foundation that exists for the
copyright laws of the United States. It is true that a copyright when
it is issued in accordance with the statute made in pursuance of that
Constitution is property, but it is not property in the historic sense
of property. It entirely lacks the notion of continuity. It entirely
lacks the notion of permanency. It is a species of property created,
and not arising out of the circumstances of civilization and human
life, as property in general has always done, long preceding
governments. It is a species of property created by the law-making
power, and a species of property created by the law-making power in a
matter not inherently subject to property right.
</p>

<p>
In creating that particular property the constitutional convention was
influenced by this consideration: We will not grant a permanent
property right in any intellectual production, because in our judgment
that would be inconsistent with the progress of civilization as a
whole, but we can consistently, with the progress of civilization as a
whole, grant a limited property right in an intellectual production.
Therefore they did provide in the Constitution that though Congress
might give to authors an exclusive right, the right must be limited in
point of duration, and therefore Congress has not the slightest power
to grant a permanent right in any intellectual production.
</p>

<p>
Victor Herbert may hereafter, as I hope he may, rival some of the great
composers of the past and produce music far better than the splendid
music that he has thus far produced, but if he does it will be
impossible for Congress to reward him and his heirs with a permanent
absolute property right in any such intellectual production. The best
we can do, Mr. Herbert, is to give you a limited right to your
intellectual production. That limited right is limited not only in
respect of duration, but it is limited in respect of quality, in
respect of formal expression, and it is limited thus: There shall be,
according to the constitutional provision, an exclusive right for a
limited time and for a limited form of expression, and that limited
form of expression is defined by the word "writings."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, I have spent my laborious
life as a lawyer, a scholar, an inventor, an author, and a lecturer. I
have delivered hundreds of addresses that never were reduced to
writing. I have delivered but few that were. In so far as I delivered
those lectures that were never reduced to writing, I am not entitled,
either by law or by ethical principles, to any exclusive right. I am
entitled to an exclusive right to my intellectual productions only when
I reduce them to writing and file them in the office of the Librarian
of Congress, where they will remain a permanent monument, and can be
handed down to future times and can be read and availed of by my
contemporaries.
</p>

<p>
The Constitutional Convention wisely provided that if the American
people are to grant a monopoly in an intellectual production the man
who makes that intellectual production shall give it to the American
people; and he gives it to the American people by first furnishing them
the fullest information of its character, in the case of a patent, or
in the case of a copyright he gives it to the American people by
consenting to the terms upon which it was issued, namely, that it shall
be free after the expiration of the limited time for which it was
granted. Further than that, in taking out a copyright, or in taking out
a patent, the man consents that the copyright shall be confined to his
writing, and shall not extend to any other form of expression of his
intellectual idea.
</p>

<p>
I am not alone in this. The Supreme Court of the United States is with
me.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Just a moment: It has not occurred to me that this
is not either a question of continuity of property or a question of the
quality of the property. It is simply a question of just to what extent
people are to be given the control of their own writings, and as to
just through what different forms they will be able to trace their
property.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. That is the question, and that is the exact
question which I am going to address myself to now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Very well.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. The case of the "Trade-Mark Cases" was decided by
the Supreme Court of the United States in 1880, and it is reported in
100 United States Reports, at page 94. In that case the owners of
certain collocations of words which they were using as trade-marks
sought to sustain the validity of their trade-mark under the copyright
law, holding that those words constituted writings which were
copyrightable and which had been copyrighted.
</p>

<p>
The Supreme Court unanimously decided that the statute which they
invoked, which statute was abundantly broad enough to cover that
provision, was unconstitutional, because although these collocations of
words were writings in the literal sense they were not writings within
the sense of the Constitution. In so deciding, the Supreme Court
narrowed down the meaning of the word "writings" instead of extending
it, by holding that the Constitution gives a monopoly not to writings
in general but only to such writings as have some literary character
and permanent value in themselves. This is the language of Justice
Miller:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
And while the word writings may be liberally construed, as it has
been, to include original designs for engravings, prints, etc., it
is only such as are original and are founded in the creative powers
of the mind. The writings which are to be protected are the fruits
of intellectual labor, embodied in the form of books, prints,
engravings, and the like.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The case which the Supreme Court had before it on this subject next is
the Sarony case, decided in 1883, and reported in 111 U.S., page 58.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. We had that yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. In that case Mr. Sarony sought to sustain the
validity of a copyright upon a photograph of that then very ornamental
gentleman, Oscar Wilde. It turned out that in this picture which Mr.
Sarony personally took of Oscar Wilde, in his esthetic costume at the
time he captured the hearts of the American women by his highly
ornamental appearance [laughter], Mr. Sarony had personally posed Oscar
Wilde, so as to give him a peculiar beauty, which might not have been
developed by the ordinary photographer; and the Supreme Court of the
United States sustained the validity of that particular copyright upon
the particular ground that Mr. Sarony put particular skill in the
posing of the man so as to produce a particularly artistic effect.
</p>

<p>
But if I should go into a photograph gallery and have somebody pose me
who did not have that skill&mdash;and also because the subject would not
admit of it, and would not produce any particularly attractive
effect&mdash;and the attempt should be made to copyright that photograph, he
would go right up against the decision of the Supreme Court in the
Sarony case, and he would be told that the copyright was invalid,
because it did not involve any intellectual effort in its production.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I think your picture would influence the committee
quite as much as Oscar Wilde's. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Well, Oscar Wilde is dead, and not here to speak
for himself; and I am living still.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. I hope you will live long, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
The next case, and the last case in which these matters have been
before the Supreme Court, is the case of Higgins <i>v.</i> Keuffel,
decided by that tribunal in the October term of 1890, and reported in
140 U.S.
</p>

<p>
In that case a copyright had been issued, in strict conformity with the
copyright law of 1874, upon a label used for manufacturing purposes, as
a label on a bottle or a package. There was no doubt whatever but what
the copyright was in strict conformity with the statute, but the
Supreme Court held that the statute was unconstitutional, because
although the label was a writing, it was not a writing in the sense
that the Supreme Court had defined that word in the Trade-Mark cases.
Here Justice Field delivered the opinion of the court, and he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The clause of the Constitution under which Congress is authorized
to legislate for the protection of authors and inventors is
contained in the eighth section of Article 1, which declares that
"the Congress shall have power to promote the progress of science
and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and
inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries."
</p>

<p>
This provision evidently has reference only to such writings and
discoveries as are the result of intellectual labor. It was so held
in the Trade-Mark cases, where the court said that "while the word
'writing' may be liberally construed, as it has been, to include
original designs for engravings, prints, etc., it is only such as
are original and are founded in the creative powers of the mind."
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the year 1888, a suit was brought in the United States circuit court
for the eastern district of Massachusetts for the purpose of subjecting
a perforated roll like one of these [exhibiting] to the domain of a
copyright upon a sheet of music which had been lawfully and regularly
copyrighted. That case was elaborately litigated, and was the subject
of argument on both sides before his honor, Judge Colt, then the
circuit judge and now the chief judge of the circuit court of appeals
for the first judicial circuit.
</p>

<p>
Judge Colt in that case, commonly called the McTamanny case, gave an
elaborate and learned decision to the effect that this perforated paper
roll, or any sheet of perforated paper like it, intended for the
mechanical reproduction of a tune, did not infringe a copyright upon
the tune thus reproduced.
</p>

<p>
That was in 1888, and that decision was universally acquiesced in by
all the judges and all the people of the United States for thirteen
years. During that thirteen years a number of gentlemen devoted
themselves to making the machines, pianolas, or whatnot, that are
capable of being used with these perforated sheets; and among those
gentlemen is the modest and excellent inventor, Mr. Davis, who appeared
before the committee yesterday. Those men proceeded in full reliance
upon the decision of Judge Colt, acquiesced in by everybody that they
had a perfect right to perforate those sheets of music and use them in
mechanical playing instruments; and great amounts of ingenuity have
been devoted to the development of that particular art, and large
amounts of capital have been devoted to it, in full reliance upon the
decision of Judge Colt, in which everybody acquiesced. But the Æolian
Company, of Meriden, Conn.&mdash;and in the statement that I am about to
make I am going to state what is true; I can not prove the statements
here to-day, but I could prove them if the committee should sit and
take testimony and send for persons and papers&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. You can file the proof, can you not, Mr.
Walker?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. It would be like a big litigation to do so, and it
would be putting a very heavy expense upon me that I would hardly be
called upon to bear. But I can tell you how I know.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. If the statements that you are to make now are
not true, gentlemen can controvert them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Certainly. They have had chances to controvert
them heretofore. This is not the first time that I am making these
statements in public. I have made them in court over and over again,
and they have passed entirely unchallenged, because they are perfectly
true.
</p>

<p>
The Æolian Company made certain contracts with a large number of
members, and I think with every one of the members of the Musical
Publishers' Association&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. I beg to deny that&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Later on you can be heard, if you wish.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. A gentleman showed me one of the contracts to-day,
and I have it in my pocket.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. It was the one offered in evidence.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I can not be interrupted. I am telling what I know
to be true.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You shall not be interrupted, Mr. Walker.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Thank you. The Æolian Company made contracts with
nearly all or all of the members of the Musical Publishers'
Association. Each of those contracts provided as follows: That the
particular member of the Music Publishers' Association granted to the
Æolian Company the exclusive right to make perforated sheets of paper
to play the tunes represented by all of the music published by that
particular publisher; and that contract also provided that the Æolian
Company should never pay any money for that exclusive right until the
Æolian Company succeeded in getting some court to decide that the
copyright laws covered the perforated paper roll. That contract also
provided that the Æolian Company should pay all the expenses of some
test suit made for the purpose of testing that question.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of that contract, the Æolian Company caused the
White-Smith Music Publishing Company to bring a suit against the Apollo
Company, in the southern district of New York, upon a couple of little
negro melodies, one of which was entitled "Little Cotton Dolly" and the
other of which was entitled "The Kentucky Babe Schottische." I fancy
that the copyright on both those negro melodies was not worth as much
as a dollar and a half, and that certainly $3 would cover the value of
both of them; but they answered the purpose of a test case.
</p>

<p>
The Æolian Company poured out money like water in that litigation, and
endeavored to secure from the United States courts a reversal of the
decision of Judge Colt, which had been made many years before. In the
course of that litigation I was retained by the Automusic Perforating
Company, which was not a party to this litigation, but which had an
interest a hundred times greater than that of the nominal defendant. In
pursuance of that retainer I presented a petition to Judge Hazel,
before whom the case was heard, and in that petition I asked that my
client be made a defendant. And I set forth in that petition the whole
Æolian scheme in full, with all the clearness of statement of which I
was capable, and it was sworn to by my client.
</p>

<p>
When that statement was filed before the judge, a printed copy was
served upon the attorney for the Æolian Company, Mr. Charles E. Hughes,
one of the ablest men in the United States, who has distinguished
himself in the recent insurance investigation in New York. Anything
that he does not think of is not likely to be worth thinking of, and
when he put in, as he did, an elaborate brief in reply to my petition,
he did not controvert one solitary word of the statement of evidence
set forth in the petition about the inherent character of the Æolian
scheme, which he would have done if he could have done so.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. What was his reply&mdash;raising questions of law?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I do not think his reply amounted to a row of
pins.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Is that a matter of printed record?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. His reply? I have a copy of his brief in my office
in New York.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Will you send that to the committee?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I will; yes.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Clapp</span>. And your petition?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. He raised the question of jurisdiction in his
reply, did he not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. No; not at all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. What was his reply, if you remember?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I would rather not tell, because I do not think it
is particularly creditable to Mr. Hughes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. You just complimented him very highly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. And I do not desire to deduct anything from that
compliment.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. You are going to file a copy of it, are you not?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes; but my time is limited, and if I gave the
honorable gentleman from New York an account of that it would take me
ten minutes to do so.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You will have an opportunity to inspect his
reply and that petition when we have the records here.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Now, let me tell you the rest of the story. His
reply did not contain a word controverting my statements of fact in the
petition. He did not take any issue with the statements of fact in the
petition at all&mdash;not the slightest. But so far as his reply contained
any matter at all, it was first of all an attempt to show that my
client was not entitled to be admitted as a defendant anyway, and that,
if I was entitled to be heard, he took the ground that my argument was
not very conclusive. He did not reflect upon the petition at all; his
reply applied entirely to my argument.
</p>

<p>
Judge Hazel afterwards overruled the petition, and the same day that he
overruled the petition he decided the case in favor of the defendant,
and followed my brief in his decision. So that the intellectual origin
of Judge Hazel's decision can be traced back to the brief that I filed
in pursuance of the petition which he overruled.
</p>

<p>
Very well. The Æolian people then caused that case to be appealed to
the circuit court of appeals. When the case came up there I filed a
petition in that court to be permitted to argue the case on behalf of
the defendant, and also file a brief, both of which petitions were
granted. In that petition I repeated the whole Æolian story over again,
and I served a copy of that petition on Mr. Hughes a week before the
argument came up, and he had abundant opportunity to reply to it. I
also called him up and asked him if he was going to reply to it, and he
said "No." And when he came to the argument he was as silent as the
grave; though he had nearly two hours for his speech, he was as silent
as was the grave in respect to all the allegations I had made about the
inherent character of the Æolian scheme, and confined himself entirely
to attempting to persuade the court that a perforated paper roll was an
infringement of sheet music, and that however unconscientious the
Æolian scheme might be as the representative of the Æolian company it
was entitled to the pound of flesh.
</p>

<p>
And that was the way he met the second presentation of the Æolian
scheme. Afterwards, two weeks ago yesterday, the circuit court of
appeals for the second circuit decided against him again.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. How long ago?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Two weeks ago yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. The decision is in the record already.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Certainly.
</p>

<p>
Now, I wish to say this to the committee, that that Æolian scheme is
the most ingenious scheme that I ever knew to be invented by anybody in
this country for the purpose of acquiring wealth by means of a patent
or a copyright monopoly. And, further than that, I wish to say that the
Æolian scheme is so ingenious that it does not violate any law whatever
except one, and that is the golden rule. You can not square the Æolian
scheme with the Sermon on the Mount, but you can square it with the
Sherman antitrust act, and you can square it with every statute on the
statute books. They have dodged a violation of every statute in
inventing their scheme. And now they lack nothing at all to consummate
their scheme except for Congress to pass this bill in the form in which
it is drawn. That will place the capstone upon the monument, and will
give to the Æolian Company a million of dollars a year out of the
pockets of the people of the United States. And of that million of
dollars they will keep at least $900,000, and about $90,000 of the rest
will go to the music publishers, and not one cent over $10,000 of the
whole million will go into the pockets of any music composers during
their natural lives.
</p>

<p>
In the nature of the case it must be so. My statements are not based
alone upon any special contracts or facts; but as long as human nature
remains as it is, as long as the business problem involved in
mechanical playing instruments remains as it is, it must be true that a
proposition, if enacted and enforced, to subject perforated music rolls
to copyright protection will enormously burden the American people for
the benefit of corporations and middlemen, and only very slightly for
the benefit of musical composers.
</p>

<p>
These distinguished gentlemen&mdash;Mr. Herbert and Mr. Sousa&mdash;are so
distinguished that they can make their own terms, and this bill would
enrich them. I do not see that they need to be enriched. I believe that
these gentlemen, for amusing the American people, are each one of them
receiving more money than Theodore Roosevelt is receiving for
regulating the affairs of mankind. [Laughter.] And I myself have
contributed many a dollar to their coffers, and I have always obtained
full value therefor. I have had the pleasure of listening to two of
their operas lately, and if any of you gentlemen get a chance to hear
one of them I hope you will not miss it, because it is worth the price.
</p>

<p>
But this business problem that I am expounding is one of great
complexity, and while the result of many years of experience with this
general topic and the result of many months of special investigation of
this subject convinces me that all my statements as to how the thing
must work are correct, I can not, in any brief period of time, prove
these statements to be true by depositions or testimony of witnesses.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Can you give us an illustration of the respect in
which the mere copyrighting of the music roll will do all that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes; I can. I think I can do it in three or four
minutes.
</p>

<p>
The music that the American people want to play now is made up of two
kinds&mdash;classic music, uncopyrighted music, and the current music that
comes out. Now, if this scheme were carried out the Æolian people would
have the exclusive right to perforate paper rolls in accordance with
all the current music covered by their contracts with the music
publishers; and those contracts cover at least nine-tenths of all the
music being produced month by month and year by year.
</p>

<p>
Now, inasmuch as the Æolian Company would have the exclusive right to
perforate sheets for half the music that the people want, nobody could
sell a music-playing instrument unless it was manufactured by the
Æolian Company, because the Æolian Company as a part of their policy
would refuse to sell their perforated sheets except for use in
connection with their own instruments; and this would be the situation:
You want to buy a pianola. You go to New York and call on the Æolian
people. They say: "We will sell you a pianola, and if you buy it from
us you can use it to play any tune known to man, classical or modern.
Go over to our neighbor across the street, and he will sell you a
pianola, too, but he can only sell you music rolls to represent classic
music and uncopyrighted music. If you are contented with Beethoven and
Mozart and the masters, and do not care for Sousa and Victor Herbert
and their contemporaries, go across the street and buy your pianola.
But if you want a pianola that will enable you to play any copyrighted
music at all, you must buy it from us; for there is not another party
in the United States that can sell you one of those machines."
</p>

<p>
So that the passage and enforcement of this bill would practically give
the Æolian Company, of Meriden, Conn., a permanent patent on an old
machine, namely, the automatically played piano, and all other musical
instruments played by perforated paper roll.
</p>

<p>
I assure you, gentlemen, that this bill must in the nature of the case
have that operation. So that the moment that the Congress passes that
bill, if it were to be enforced by the courts afterwards, Congress
would be giving to the Æolian Company, of Meriden, Conn., a permanent
patent on that great industry, without those people ever having
invented a solitary part of the origin of the business, and without
ever having composed a single piece of music played in their machines.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Mr. Walker, had you intended to speak
specifically about the provisions of this bill?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I had, but I have been interrupted so much that I
have not been able to do so up to this point. Now I am going to devote
myself entirely to that.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You have only twenty-five minutes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I realize that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You were going to speak of the constitutionality
of the bill, also.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. That is what I am going to take up now.
</p>

<p>
The Constitution provides that copyrights may be granted on writings.
This bill provides that copyrights may be granted on works. The fourth
section of this bill reads as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That the works for which copyright may be secured under this act
shall include all the works of an author.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Although this bill purports to be founded on the Constitution, and
although the Constitution is confined to the word "writings," that word
"writings" does not appear among the 8,000 words of that bill. It is
not there once. This bill is based upon the theory that Congress has
power to grant an exclusive right to works, and the word "works" is
used more than 30 times where the word "writings" ought to have been
used, and the word "writings" is not printed in that bill from its
beginning to its end.
</p>

<p>
I am not reflecting upon any gentleman who drafted the bill in that
way, because the bill was drawn upon the theory that the Constitution
justifies copyright upon an author's works. Now, the word "works"
includes "writings" and is far more comprehensive than "writings." Take
the case of Theodore Roosevelt. He has published and printed 15 volumes
of original works, and he has delivered without writing more than 1,500
speeches. Now, those books that he has printed and those speeches that
he has delivered are equally his works, but they are not equally his
writings, because he never has reduced those speeches to writing. So
that there is a plain distinction between works and writings, and that
distinction is recognized in this bill, as follows. (Now I will devote
myself for the rest of the time to strict analysis.)
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 4.</span> That the works for which copyright may be secured
under this act shall include all the works of an author.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Then twelve classes of works are enumerated. The third of those classes
of works is said to be "oral lectures, sermons, and addresses." Now,
those productions come under the head of works, and do not come under
the head of writings, confessedly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. But they could not be copyrighted until they were
reduced to writing, could they?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes; they could, under this bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. How?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. What would you file in the copyright office?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. You do not have to file anything for a year.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I know that; but you have got to file something
then.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. But you get a year's copyright without ever doing
that, and this bill would give a man a monopoly of a whole year on a
speech never reduced to writing, and that is a "limited time." And if
he chooses ever to reduce it to writing, then all he has got to do is
to file one copy in the office of the Library of Congress and not
publish it at all.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Well, you must remember that we must confine this
to copyrighted matter.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. You must confine it quite narrowly, I think; but
please let me develop my particular thought.
</p>

<p>
It is perfectly plain that under this bill a man may have a copyright
on an oral sermon, lecture, or address and maintain that copyright for
a whole year without that discourse ever being even put into
typewriting during that period. That is a perfectly plain case,
therefore, of copyrighting a work that is not a writing.
</p>

<p>
Now, come down to subsection G, "works of art." There is another item.
Now, that word is much broader than "writings." I have made a good many
works of art myself. Everybody that invents a complicated machine
produces a work of art and a work of high art. There are a great many
works of art here in this room which could not by any possible strain
of language be denominated "writings." There is a perfectly plain case
of attempting to copyright, under this statute, a work which is not
also a writing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. What change would you suggest in subsection G?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I have formulated such a change as that, but it
would take a little time to explain it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Very well. Take your own course.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I am very glad to be at the disposal of the
committee, but it would take me five minutes to explain. It is a very
important point.
</p>

<p>
Subsection H covers "Reproductions of a work of art." There is a
perfectly flagrant case of attempting to copyright not only a thing
that is not necessarily a writing, but also a thing that is not even
original; whereas the Supreme Court has told us over and over again
that nothing can be copyrighted that is not original.
</p>

<p>
Now, go over to the next page, page 4, Class L:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Labels and prints relating to articles of manufacture, as
heretofore registered in the Patent Office under the act of June
18, 1874.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That was the very act that the Supreme Court held fifteen years ago was
unconstitutional as not authorizing copyright on things which are not
writings. So that there is a recommendation to this committee to
reenact a law that the Supreme Court has expressly held to be
unconstitutional.
</p>

<p>
Now, come, if you please, to the second page of this bill. The first
section of this bill enumerates exclusive rights to be covered by
copyright. Subsection C is:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
To deliver, or authorize the delivery of, in public for profit, any
copyrighted lecture, sermon, address, or similar production
prepared for oral delivery.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. What page is that?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. The top of page 2.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Subdivision C.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. (Reading):
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
To deliver, or authorize the delivery of, in public for profit, any
copyrighted lecture, sermon, address, or similar production
prepared for oral delivery.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A lecture could be copyrighted under this statute without any copy ever
being put even into typewriting, as I stated a little while ago, and
that copyright could be maintained for a year, when the discourse has
no existence whatever except in the mind of the man who delivers it,
and in the ears of those who heard it, and in the air that transmitted
it from the vocal organs of the lecturer.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
D&mdash;To publicly perform or represent a copyrighted dramatic work.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Section 4966 of the Revised Statutes covers that ground already, and
provides that copyright may cover the performance of dramatic work. But
I hold, and I hold without the slightest hesitation, that that whole
section 4966 is unconstitutional. No court has ever held it to be
constitutional, and any attempt on the part of Congress to grant a
copyright to enable a man to monopolize the rendering of a play on the
stage is preposterous. The fathers who went to Philadelphia in 1787 had
more weighty business on hand than to give to playwrights an added grip
on the monopoly of their productions in addition to the common-law grip
that they already had. At that time and now the author of a play is
abundantly protected under the common law, but Congress in 1870
provided an additional grip for the playwright under the copyright
statute, in face and eyes of the fact that the Constitution under which
they were acting was confined to writings. But if I do not remember
wrongly (and I think the gentleman from North Carolina will agree with
my recollection) about 1870 Congress did several things that could not
be fully vindicated under the Constitution.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Mr. Walker, have you in mind the exact language
of the Constitution?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Certainly.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Will you not put it on the record at this point?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. "Congress shall have power to promote the progress
of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors
and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries."
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"F. To publicly perform a copyrighted musical work, or any part
thereof."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, is Mr. Sousa present? If not, I see Mr. Victor Herbert here, and I
would like to ask Mr. Victor Herbert whether, during the last few
years, he has with his orchestra performed copyrighted music of other
composers, of which copyrighted music he purchased and had the sheets
there for the performance?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. With their permission.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Did you get any other permission than the purchase
of the sheets?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. That is included.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Did you get any special permission to perform?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. The permission is written on the sheet.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. What is written on the sheet?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Permission for performance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. It is on the sheet, is it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. In all cases?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. That is, on the corner of the sheets&mdash;"permission
to perform."
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Very well, if in his case it is there. But this is
the situation of the law at the present time: If one of you gentlemen
goes to church and joins in the singing of a hymn that is the subject
of a copyright, you are liable to a penalty of $100 for the first time
you join in that singing, and a penalty of $50 for every subsequent
time, unless you yourself bought that particular hymn book at first
hand from the publisher. That is the law now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Suppose the church bought it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Then you are liable for the penalty.
</p>

<p>
Now, that section 4966 has been violated more than a million times
since Congress enacted it in 1897, and Congress does not notice the
difference; and I take it that it has taken no steps to vindicate its
dignity.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. There is a bill pending before our committee on
that proposition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes; I understand about that pending bill, but I
am speaking of the law as it now exists. So that, gentlemen, I take the
ground that any legislation that gives to the composer of any music the
exclusive right to publicly perform that music is outside of the
Constitution, because a copyright on a writing can be infringed only by
writing; and when some gentleman or some lady stands up in a church and
sings a song out of his or her mind he or she is not doing anything
about any writing.
</p>

<p>
Clause G is one to which I direct attention. That clause G is the one
that is directed against all music-playing instruments. The gentleman
who preceded me did not make entirely clear the nature of this
beautiful instrument that he showed the committee, which he stated was
capable of rendering music. What he showed to the committee was a
perfectly plain steel cylinder. When you look at it you can see no&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Most members of both committees are perfectly
familiar with that instrument.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Very well; I am very glad to hear that. There are
a very great many persons who are not.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That instrument was exhibited before the House
committees in the Fifty-seventh Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Oh, yes&mdash;then you know all about it. There are a
great many gentlemen who have not been informed about it, and I thought
I would mention it.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the matters of constitutional consideration&mdash;I have twelve
minutes left, and during those twelve minutes I wish to devote myself
to some criticisms of this bill which have nothing to do with the
constitutional questions that I have been discussing. Those criticisms
are equally applicable whether the bill is to be framed and enacted on
the basis of "works," or whether it is to be framed and enacted on the
basis of "writings." And in any view that anybody may take about the
scope of the copyright, the criticisms to which I am now calling
attention deserve consideration.
</p>

<p>
The first one is in section 13, which is one of those sections that is
intended to give the American manufacturer the monopoly of
manufacturing copyrighted books.
</p>

<p>
That purpose is a good one, but that section is not well drawn to
effect that purpose, because the gentlemen who drew the section were
not thoroughly acquainted with the art of printing in its modern
development; and the suggestions I have to make to the committee are
with a view to strengthening that section so as to close up some
loopholes that the authors of the section left wide open.
</p>

<p>
The language is:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That of a printed book or periodical the text of the copies
deposited under section 11 above shall be printed from type set
within the limits of the United States, either by hand or by the
aid of any kind of typesetting machine, or from plates made from
type set within the limits of the United States, or if the text be
produced by lithographic process, then by a process wholly
performed within the limits of the United States.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The trouble there is that the author of that section supposed that the
lithographic process was the only other process of producing a book
besides printing it from type or a streotyped plate. Now, the
lithographic process is not the only process. There are modern
processes of photomechanical printing that have nothing at all to do
with lithography, that are much cheaper than lithography, and that do
all that lithography does. As an illustration, those beautiful
illustrated supplements that come out every week with the New York
Tribune on Sunday are supposed by some gentlemen to be lithographs.
They are not. They are printed on aluminum cylinders at great speed and
with great cheapness, and they are very much cheaper and very much
better than can be done by the old art of lithography.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Could not that be said to be a plate within the
meaning of this act?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. No; because a stereotype plate is meant. But that
is very easily corrected. I would suggest that for the words "by
lithographic process" be substituted "any other process." Then that
covers lithography and every other possible process. Then, on the 21st
line of that page, I would suggest the substitution of "illustrations"
for "lithographs," because illustrations may be made otherwise than by
lithography.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman who delivered himself upon that particular subject upon
behalf of the American mechanic was uninformed about the matter, and
complained that a large number of printed illustrations were being
imported into this country that would be kept out under the
lithographic clause if you put the lithographic clause in strong
enough. Now, he is entirely mistaken about that, because the very
things that are being imported and that he complains of are not made by
lithography at all, but by another process.
</p>

<p>
Section 15 contains a provision as to what shall happen if the
copyrighter does not deposit his copies in the office of the Librarian
of Congress on time; and there is a proviso in lines 19, 20, and 21
which reads:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That in such case no action shall be brought for infringement of
the copyright until such requirements have been fully complied
with.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That ought to be amended by adding the words "or be based on any
infringement begun before the time of that compliance," because
otherwise the public would have no protection at all. A man could go on
and innocently infringe during that year, and the only protection this
section gives him is that he would not be sued until after the end of
the year, but when sued the action would be retroactive; and that
amendment ought to go in to perfect the section.
</p>

<p>
Section 18 relates to the duration of copyright. Gentlemen, that is a
topic to which I have given great consideration, and I can do no more
than state my opinion. I should like to elaborate it, but what I would
recommend the committee to adopt on that subject is this very short
provision: That the copyrights secured by this act shall endure for a
hundred years in the case of an original book or dramatic or musical
composition (one hundred years, Mr. Herbert, I liberally advocate in
your behalf) and for fifty years in every other case.
</p>

<p>
I am totally opposed to any law providing for the extension of any
copyright or any patent. The public ought to know, when the copyright
comes out and when the patent comes out, exactly when it is going to
expire; and it ought not to be made contingent upon anything so
uncertain as human life. On the other hand, there is every reason in
favor of giving the copyrighter a very long period of monopoly.
Seventeen years is long enough for the patentee. I am a patentee
myself. I would be very glad indeed to have Congress extend some of my
patents, but I have not the effrontery to ask Congress to do it,
because I do not deserve it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Do you think a hundred years is a limited time
within the meaning of the Constitution?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Oh, yes; certainly. A thousand would be.
[Laughter.] And I wish to make this suggestion: It was suggested to me
that the word "limited" meant definitely limited, and that therefore
Congress would not be conforming to the Constitution if it made the
period dependent upon any uncertain contingency. Now there is some
force in that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. I agree with you, Mr. Walker, upon making the
number of years definite; whether you make the years few or many, make
them definite. Now, right there, without any intention to be facetious,
do you not think that fifty years is sufficient?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. No; and I will tell you why. Harriet Beecher Stowe
wrote "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in 1853. She got a copyright on it for
twenty-eight years, then an extension of fourteen years, and at the end
of that time, in 1895, the copyright expired. Harriet Beecher Stowe
then was dead&mdash;died in 1896&mdash;but she left two maiden daughters; and it
would be a comfort to me, and it would be a comfort to all those who
honor the memory of Harriet Beecher Stowe, if those two ladies could
now be in the receipt of some royalty from "Uncle Tom's Cabin," which
they can not be.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Is there any government that grants a patent or
copyright for more than fifty years that you know of?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Not that I know of. Fifty years would be
altogether excessive for any patent. The longest period that could
possibly be vindicated by argument for a patent would be twenty years.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. How about copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I wish I could argue the matter; but I hold that
all original works ought to be copyrighted for a hundred years, and all
derivative works, such as dictionaries and encyclopedias, for fifty.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonynge</span>. What is the longest period granted by any
government, that you recall, for a copyright?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I can not speak as to that with certainty.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Fifty years?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. The nations are numerous.
</p>

<p>
Now, I must come to another point, section 23, in respect of the
damages that may be recovered. Section 23 begins as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That if any person shall infringe the copyright in any work
protected under the copyright laws of the United States by doing or
causing to be done, without the consent of the copyright proprietor
first obtained in writing, any act the exclusive right to do or
authorize which is by such laws reserved to such proprietor, etc.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The trouble with that is that it makes the man who does the thing an
absolute infringer unless he can show a consent in writing; and that
repels the whole doctrine of implied licenses and equitable estoppel,
which two doctrines are found to be absolutely indispensable to the
administration of justice in patent cases, and heretofore in copyright
cases. The idea that there can be no answer to an infringement suit for
a copyright except a written license is new in this statute. It has
never been in any copyright law before, and it would work havoc with
justice, because it would enable the wilfully malicious copyrighters to
mislead men into unwitting infringement, and then pounce on them with
an infringement suit, and then, when they set up equitable estoppel or
an implied license, say, "Equitable estoppel and implied license do not
go in this statute. You must show a written license." Words can not
express how badly that would work.
</p>

<p>
Again, in subdivision B, this man is&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
to pay to the copyright proprietor such damages as the copyright
proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as
all the profits which the infringer may have made from such
infringement.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That is wrong, because it gives him two recoveries; and in patent cases
the courts have established for more than a quarter of a century that
the patentee is entitled to a recovery of profits or damages, whichever
he prefers, but is not entitled to recover both. No proposition has
ever been made, in any statute, to give anybody a double recovery until
it is made here; and here he is told that he shall have both. And what
is worse, down at the bottom there of the subsection, if it turns out
that there were no damages inflicted and no profits made, then the
provision is that the judge shall fix the damages at such a sum as he
finds to be just; and then, after the judge is told to exercise his
discretion to fix a just sum, he is told that that sum must not be less
than $250.
</p>

<p>
On page 18, among the evils and misfortunes that are to be inflicted
upon the unwitting infringer as well as the willful infringer, is the
following. He must&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
deliver up on oath, to be impounded during the pendency of action,
upon such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe, all
goods alleged to infringe a copyright.
</p>
</div>

<p>
So that if anybody wants to drive his competitor out of business, all
he has to do is to file a bill alleging that the competing goods
infringe, and he does not even have to swear to that; and then, in
pursuance of that bill, all the property of that alleged infringer is
impounded during the course of the litigation. And it would be a very
dull complainant that could not keep the litigation going at least five
years, and to that extent eliminate competition.
</p>

<p>
The next one is wickeder still. The infringer must&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
deliver up on oath for destruction all the infringing copies or
devices, etc.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Here is a case of an unwitting infringer. He is found to infringe. He
thought he did not infringe. Good lawyers told him he did not. The
court finally found that he did, and there, among the penalties, all
his goods must be delivered up for destruction. Now, that is entirely
wrong. The courts have decided in patent cases that under precisely
those circumstances the defendant has a right to export his goods and
sell them in foreign countries; and there is no ethical and no legal
reason why an unwitting infringer of a copyright, after having been
found to infringe in this country, should not export his goods and sell
them elsewhere. And the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit
has unanimously decided, in patent cases, that that is perfectly right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Not only the copyrighted goods, but the machines
themselves.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I will come to the other point&mdash;certainly; and he
must not only have those destroyed, but the "plates, molds, matrices,
or other means of making such infringing copies."
</p>

<p>
My client, the Automusic Perforating Company, has a plant that cost
$50,000. That mechanism is adapted to perforating rolls, and if they
should use that mechanism in perforating 500 rolls with perfect right,
and then inadvertently use that mechanism in perforating one roll that
was held to infringe, under this bill their whole plant would be
cleared out of their place and would be destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Gentlemen, that is so surprising a proposition that I presume it may be
of interest to know the origin of it. The patent laws of England
provide that, at the discretion of the court, infringing material may
be destroyed. That is because the Parliament of England is not subject
to any constitutional limitations, and can pass any kind of a law that
it pleases. Mr. Justice Gray knew more about the laws of England than
he did about the laws of America; and at one time, one of the two times
when he was deciding a patent case while he was on the bench, he ran
across an English decision in which it was held that the infringing
goods might be destroyed. And then, by way of obiter dictum, without
having the slightest occasion to do so, he wrote into the decision an
obiter dictum to the effect that that was the law of this country. But
the judges of the circuit courts know better, and never have enforced
that obiter dictum. And if they were to enforce it they would violate
two or three provisions of the Constitution, among others that no
person shall be deprived of property without due process of law.
</p>

<p>
But the authors of this provision, taking the hint from that obiter
dictum of Justice Gray, have not only applied it to the same matter
that Judge Gray applied it to, namely, the infringing thing itself, but
to the entire plant of the infringer.
</p>

<p>
(At this point it was announced that Mr. Walker's time was up.)
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. I promised to stop at the end of an hour, and I
will do so.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Can you finish what you desire to say regarding
the provisions of this bill in five minutes additional?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Well, I can talk five minutes; I ought to have
ten. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We will give you five minutes more because of
the interruptions.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Section 30, in respect to this matter of importations&mdash;I am now
speaking on behalf of the gentlemen, no one of whom I know, namely,
those who desire to be protected in this country against the
competition of the labor of Europe in getting up copyrighted books.
Section 30 reads:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That during the existence of the American copyright in any book the
importation into the United States of any foreign edition or
editions thereof (although authorized by the author or proprietor)
not printed from type set within the limits of the United States or
from plates made therefrom, or any plates of the same not made from
type set within the limits of the United States, or any editions
thereof produced by lithographic process not performed within the
limits of the United States, in accordance with the requirements of
section 13 of this act, shall be, and is hereby, prohibited.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, gentlemen of the committee, that prohibition does not amount to a
row of pins. It is as void as is the atmosphere around the North Pole
at Christmas time of all human interest, because, although one would
suppose by a superficial reading that it put a fence up around all
parts of the lot, it leaves at least half the sides of the lot entirely
uninclosed. Thus, it prohibits nothing except the importation of an
entire edition. Now, somebody may say: "No; it is not an entire edition
it is aimed at, but only one specimen of the edition."
</p>

<p>
But I say in response to that, that that language "Edition or editions"
is taken out of the present statute, and in the present statute the
words "edition or editions" are confined in their meaning to entire
editions by the circumstance that the present statute prohibits also
the importation of individual copies. So that if Congress were to enact
that section, and it should come before a court, the lawyer for the
defendant would say: "It is perfectly plain that Congress intended to
change the law. Formerly, in its wisdom, it prohibited the importation
of an edition or editions, and also the importation of individual
copies. Now it has expressly left out prohibition of the importation of
individual copies and prohibited only the importation of an entire
edition," and there would not be any answer whatever to that argument.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Then, in the interest of the working people of the
United States, you would prefer to have the law left just as it is now?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. That would be much better than this; but I would
strengthen that law. I know how to strengthen it, and I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Will you tell us, briefly, how you would
strengthen the present law?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes; I would do it by amending this section in
three places, very simply, if the stenographer will take this down.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. He takes everything down.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Very well. I propose that section 30 be amended in
the interest of American mechanics by substituting the word "copy" for
the words "edition or editions" in line 5 of page 23. Then in line 9 of
that section&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. "Or any part thereof?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Wait a moment&mdash;and by substituting the word "copy"
for the word "editions" in line 9 of page 23; and by substituting the
words "any other" for the word "lithographic" in line 10 of page 23.
Now, with those amendments, every door would be closed, and the
American mechanic would be protected at every point.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Would that preclude any part of that edition being
imported?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. It would, because that language, "or any part
thereof," is contained elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Section 32: There is a statement that&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
all actions arising under the copyright laws of the United States
shall be originally cognizable by the circuit courts of the United
States, the district court of any Territory, the supreme court of
the District of Columbia, the district courts of Alaska, Hawaii,
and Porto Rico, and the courts of first instance of the Philippine
Islands.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Gentlemen, one of the competitors of the gentlemen before me wrote an
opera, and that was George Ade, and in this opera he inserted this
witticism:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The Constitution may follow the flag, but the cocktail is sure to.
</p>
</div>

<p>
We are told by the Supreme Court that the Constitution does not follow
the flag necessarily; it follows it if Congress sends it there. Now, if
in the wisdom of Congress the copyright law should be extended to
Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands, that can be accomplished
only by a statute expressing that intention. And the statement that the
courts in those outlying regions shall have jurisdiction of copyright
cases amounts to nothing unless you extend the copyright laws to those
portions of the earth's surface. I am not in favor of doing it; but if
you want to make copyrights effective in those outlying regions you
must do so by express enactment.
</p>

<p>
Here is a more important matter:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Actions arising under this act may be instituted in the district of
which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in the district where the
violation of any provision of this act has occurred.
</p>

<p>
That ought to be amended by substituting the word "his" for the
word "the," because as it reads now you can sue a man for somebody
else's infringement.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. So that it would read "his violation?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes; substitute "his" for "the." Then there should
be added to that section this language: "And wherein the defendant has
a regular and established place of business."
</p>

<p>
The public policy involved in that point has been threshed out for many
years in patent cases; and in patent cases it has been found to be
unjust to compel anybody to submit to an action for infringement of a
patent in any district unless it be in the district of which he is an
inhabitant, or a district where he has a regular and established place
of business. You can not sue somebody for infringing a patent merely by
proving that he did formerly infringe that patent in a particular
district away from home, or by finding him in that particular place.
You can not go to Chicago and sue a New York man for infringing a
patent on the allegation that a year or so ago he did infringe that
patent in the northern district of Illinois, unless you prove also that
he has a regular and established place of business in Chicago. No man
ought to be sued for infringing a copyright except in the district
where he resides; or, lacking that, in the district where he is engaged
in business.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Then you would favor the defendant rather than the
complainant in such a case?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. No; I would be just to both; and my proposition is
deduced from the present patent statute, and that patent statute is
deduced from considerations of justice as they have worked out during
fifty years of patent litigation as on the whole being most equitable.
</p>

<p>
Section 35 provides that "In all recoveries under this act full costs
shall be allowed."
</p>

<p>
That ought to be amended by substituting the word "actions" for the
word "recoveries," so as to permit recovery in behalf of a successful
defendant as well as in behalf of a successful complainant; and the
word "full" ought to be erased, and these words ought to be added "in
accordance with law," so that the section would read:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That in all actions under this act, costs shall be allowed in
accordance with law;
</p>
</div>

<p>
and the law that would be put into operation by that amendment would be
those general statutes of the United States which relate to the
taxation of costs in all litigations in the United States courts.
</p>

<p>
Here is a bad section, 43&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
That in place of the original instrument of assignment there may be
sent for record a true copy of the same, duly certified as such by
any official authorized to take an acknowledgment to a deed.
</p>
</div>

<p>
That opens the door wide to fraud, because hardly anything is easier
than to get a notary public to certify that one document is a copy of
another, particularly where he is acting in a capacity outside of his
office, and therefore would not be liable for any inconvenience or
penalty if the certificate should turn out to be false. So here is a
proposition to make the ownership of a copyright depend upon the record
in the copyright office of an alleged copy of an assignment, which
alleged copy may be fraudulent, and if fraudulent then resulting in no
punishment to the wrongdoer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You would confine that to some other official,
then; would you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. No; I would take it out altogether, and leave it
as in patent cases&mdash;that only originals are entitled to be recorded.
Such a thing as allowing a copy of an assignment of a patent or a
copyright to be recorded in the place of the original is entirely
unknown, and it would open the door widely to fraud.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Your time has expired, Mr. Walker.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Yes. I wish to express my thanks to the committee
for hearing me so long and so patiently, and to express my best wishes
for the future of the bill, and my own entire willingness to
contribute, if I am found to be competent to contribute, to the
perfection of the bill hereafter.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. Mr. Walker, I have been wondering, for the hour
that you have been delivering your intelligent speech here, on what
basis your congratulations were extended to Mr. Putnam and other
persons who took part in the preparation of this bill. [Laughter.]
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Why, I am surprised that you did not see that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. I can say, Senator, It is because they have had
the benefit of such lucid criticism at such an early stage. I can say
that it was not expected by us that anyone would take up this bill with
such a penetrating intelligence as Mr. Walker has shown, within a week
after its introduction into Congress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. And I wish to say to the Senator from Utah, if I
may be permitted, that while I have criticized this bill in plain
terms, the framework of the bill as a whole is very scientific, and in
one day or two days I could so amend the bill as to entirely remove all
my objections and still preserve the substance of the scheme which Mr.
Putnam has put upon paper.
</p>

<p>
Senator <span class="sc">Smoot</span>. I have been very much interested, Mr. Walker,
in your statement.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the Senator from Utah;
I have been very much interested in what Mr. Walker has said, and I was
going to make this suggestion: That he be allowed to file a brief with
the committee, which will be printed in the record as a part of the
record.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. That was understood the other day.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>. Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Sulzer</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would be glad to have the
committee hear now Mr. Nathan Burkan, who represents the publishers and
composers of music.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Mr. Sulzer, two gentlemen who are now present
have come all the way from Chicago to address the committee and have
just this moment gotten here.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We will hear Mr. Burkan after them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. We will hear him later.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Putnam</span>. Mr. Chairman, you have requested me to remind the
gentlemen present that it is the desire of the committee to have a
register of the names of all who have attended these hearings, and the
capacity (if they desire to indicate it) in which they have been here.
Some of you who were not here before will find opportunity to register
at the door, and I would suggest that as the register was not opened
until Thursday, any of you who know of any persons present on Wednesday
who had left by Thursday, and whose names therefore did not appear upon
the register, will please pass a memorandum of their names in to us.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman, I have a memorandum handed in which I offer to the
committee on behalf of Mr. Charles W. Ames, calling attention to a
misunderstanding, as he has believed, of two sections, section 3 and
section 19, and another communication simply filing objections to
certain sections, 13, 18, 32, 33, and 34, and desiring an opportunity
later to be heard.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. They will go in the record.

<p>
<i>Section 13, page 9.</i>&mdash;I have always objected to the proposed
affidavits of domestic manufacture. I believe there is no real need
for it and that it imposes an unnecessary burden on the copyright
proprietor and the copyright office. It has been demanded only by
the Typographical Union, which claims to have private reasons for
believing that the requirement of domestic manufacture is being
frequently violated by publishers. The records of the copyright
office do not show such violations, nor have I ever heard of any
being shown in the courts. The publishers generally throughout the
country regard this requirement as an imposition and an
outrage&mdash;that on the suspicion of the Typographical Union they
should be required to swear that they were not violating the law
whenever they take out copyright. The publishers would have
questioned the propriety of this measure when it was pending before
the last Congress if opportunity had been offered, and strenuous
opposition would have been made to the passage of the bill.
</p>

<p>
At the first conference last year, the representatives of the
Association of Publishers, in a spirit of conciliation, agreed with
the representatives of the Typographical Union that they would not
oppose the requirement of an affidavit. As a member of that
Association of Publishers. I shall not now oppose the affidavit
section as a whole, which requires me to swear five hundred times a
year that I have done something, failure to do which would have
invalidated many thousands of dollars' worth of copyright property.
</p>

<p>
But I do object earnestly and emphatically to the final paragraph
of section 13 (lines 21-25, p. 9), requiring the statement in the
affidavit of the particular establishment in which the work has
been done. This fact is wholly irrelevant to the purpose of the
affidavit and has no bearing on the requirements of the copyright
law. It is purely a private business matter. In case the affidavit
is challenged (as it would be in only an infinitesimal proportion
of registrations) and proof of domestic manufacture is required in
any action, of course the establishment would be readily shown.
Copyright proprietors should not be required to disclose it
otherwise, satisfying the curiosity of business rivals and others.
</p>

<p>
It seems also an unnecessary insult to the publishers to provide
special penalties for false affidavits. Will not the ordinary
penalties for the crime of perjury be sufficient to cover all cases
where publishers, in addition to jeopardizing their property rights
by violating the provision for domestic manufacture, swear falsely
in the premises?
</p>

<p>
I believe that Mr. Sullivan, in behalf of the Typographical Union,
stated at the last conference that the union was not disposed to
insist on the specification of the establishment in the affidavit
if it should appear that this fact was unnecessary and irrelevant
to the purpose of the affidavit. I hope that the union will make no
opposition to the elimination of this provision, which is obnoxious
to the publishers. By so doing they will at least minimize the
opposition of the publishers to the affidavit provision as a whole.
There are very many publishers throughout the country who are not
members of the association referred to, and will not be governed by
the agreement made at the conference.
</p>

<p>
The date of publication, if given in the affidavit, might serve for
convenience as furnishing an essential fact to be a part of the
record covered by the Librarian's certificate.
</p>

<p>
<i>Section 18, page 14.</i>&mdash;This section relates to the term of
copyright. In fixing the term I think due consideration has never
been given to the fact that a vast majority of copyrights become
commercially worthless after a very few years. Thus the records of
the copyright office show that last year but 2.7 per cent of the
copyrights completing their original term of twenty-eight years
were thought by the authors of sufficient value to renew them for
the additional fourteen years under the comparatively simple
provisions of the present law.
</p>

<p>
It is safe to say that not more than 5 per cent of all the
copyrights have any commercial value after twenty-eight years. It
would seem feasible to provide for the extension of the property
rights in these valuable literary or artistic properties without
conferring undeserved or undesired extensions of term in hundreds
of thousands of copyrights of no pecuniary value to the owners. On
the other hand, there is some intrinsic value to the public in a
portion of the copyrighted material after it has lost all pecuniary
value to the author or his assignee.
</p>

<p>
I believe that the great majority of copyrights should fall into
the public domain at a definite and easily ascertainable time. I
hold, therefore, that the ordinary copyright term should be no
longer than the twenty-eight years as fixed at present. But the few
valuable copyrights could be secured for a much longer term by a
simple and easy arrangement for renewal, as by requiring merely the
filing of a notice of the desire to extend and allowing the author
or his heirs to file such notice; or, in case there has been an
outright assignment, permitting the author and assignee or licensee
under royalty to join as provided in section 32 of the present
draft.
</p>

<p>
Some provision should also be made for the renewal of valuable
proprietary copyrights of the sort enumerated in subsection
<i>(b)</i> of section 18.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sections 32-33, pages 26-27.</i>&mdash;My most serious and strenuous
objections are to this section 32, regarding actions arising under
the copyright law, and especially the second paragraph, providing
that actions may be brought and jurisdiction secured in any
district of the United States where violation of any provision of
this act has occurred. This means that any copyright proprietor or
any publisher may be brought into any district in the United States
or every district simultaneously in the case of many articles sold
generally throughout the country. And it therefore concerns very
nearly every person interested in the copyright law.
</p>

<p>
Every copyright proprietor may be defendant in a suit as well as
complainant. Suits may be brought in good faith or for malicious
reasons; for the real protection of property or for harassing
business rivals. They may be well founded or groundless, honest or
frivolous. Now, speaking as the proprietor of a large number of
copyrights and a great deal of valuable copyright property which I
am anxious to protect against infringement, I would much prefer to
forego the advantages offered to complainants under this section
rather than run the risk of the infinite vexation which might be
caused my company as defendant in malicious and frivolous suits
brought in foreign jurisdictions chiefly for purposes of blackmail.
</p>

<p>
I see no good reason why copyright proprietors should have
facilities for the use of the Federal courts not accorded to any
other class of suitors. It is true that certain classes of
copyright property may require special provisions for their
protection, but it should be noted that section 966 of the Revised
Statutes is by this bill retained (see sec. 64), and would
therefore still protect dramatists and musical people in the
peculiar rights which they now have under the present law.
</p>

<p>
The penal provisions of this bill are severe and even harsh,
including misdemeanor clauses with fines and forfeitures and even
imprisonment. On the other hand, the law is full of novel
provisions. It will be, at best, years before these can be
judicially construed so that they may be generally understood.
Meanwhile, everyone concerned will find many doubtful points and
open questions on which legal advice will vary, and can in no case
be conclusive. To subject authors and publishers to the danger of
being peremptorily summoned to defend an action in a distant
district for some supposed violation of some provision, "any
provision of this act," however insignificant, with the issuance of
ex parte injunctions operative throughout the whole country, with
possible "impounding" of important and valuable publications for an
indefinite period of time (during the pendency of the suit, see
sec. 23, p. 18), a publisher in New York might sue his neighbor
across the street in any distant district, possibly Alaska or the
Philippine Islands; a rich and powerful house might crush a feeble
competitor by forcing him to defend suits brought simultaneously in
a hundred jurisdictions. These possibilities may well terrorize all
persons interested in copyrightable property of any description.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I say from long experience that it is a mistaken kindness
to make copyright litigation easy. The protection of the copyright
law is chiefly moral. Remedies for actual wrongs committed are in
most cases illusory. A copyright suit should never be brought
except for the most serious reasons and to protect large business
interests.
</p>

<p>
I believe, therefore, that section 32 should be eliminated
altogether from this bill, unless it is thought necessary to retain
the first paragraph; and I suppose section 33 would go with it. If
this were done, perhaps section 4966 of the Revised Statutes should
be incorporated in the new law at this point and reenacted for the
sake of completeness, if the committee thinks that it should be
retained.
</p>

<p>
<i>Section 34, page 28.</i>&mdash;The limitation of actions in the
present law applies only to actions for penalties and forfeitures.
I do not think it should be applied, as in this section 34, to all
actions; if it should be so applied the term should be at least six
years (which is the rule with patents, I understand). The statutes
should show clearly that the time runs from the date of the
discovery of infringement by the complainant. In these days of an
ever-increasing multitude of publications, the copyright proprietor
should not be required to examine everything which is issued to see
whether his works have possibly been pirated; nor should he be
debarred from seeking a remedy if knowledge of piracy should come
to him long after the offense has been committed. Unfairness is not
always shown on the face of an infringing work, and direct evidence
is often required to prove this even to the injured proprietor.

<span class="sc">June 9, 1906.</span>
</p>

<p>
As a constant attendant at the last two conferences, I venture to
offer a few words in explanation of two sections of this bill,
which, I think, have been misunderstood by some of the gentlemen
who have appeared before the committee.
</p>

<p>
Section 3 has been supposed to have some particular reference to
and bearing on now existing copyrights taken under the present law.
On the contrary, I understand this section to be general and
permanent in its character, the purpose of the last three lines
being to specifically protect all copyrighted matter for its proper
term and no longer, when reproduced in whole or in part, under
license or otherwise, in connection with a later copyrighted work.
This section is very important as definitely clearing up for the
future a question which has been frequently raised in connection
with the present law.
</p>

<p>
Section 19, on the other hand, relates merely to now existing
copyrights. It has the laudable purpose of extending the benefits
of the new law to authors of valuable literary and artistic works
copyrighted under the present law. The provisions at the end of the
section are designed to secure such new privileges to the authors
without interfering with the vested rights and investments of their
publishers. After such authors have enjoyed the full forty-two
years of monopoly granted them under existing law, they may secure
such additional term as is to be accorded to authors under the new
law; but if under the contracts which they have already made they
have conferred rights upon their publishers as assignees or
licensees, then they must have the publishers join with them in
their request for the extension.
</p>

<p>
It is questionable whether, in the absence of such provision, the
new privileges could be lawfully conferred upon authors who have
assigned their rights without impairment of existing contracts. For
example, when an author has sold his copyright altogether, the
publisher has combined with the literary property investment in
plates, stock, and good will, which should not be taken from him at
the expiration of the copyright term. In such cases, he could,
under the provisions of the present section, secure an extension of
exclusive rights only with the help of the author with proper
compensation, and the author could secure extension only by fair
consideration of the publisher's rights. If they fail to agree,
they are left just where they expected to be when they made their
contract under the terms of the present law.
</p>

<p>
As to the licensee for publication under royalty, I see no
objection to the addition of such a provision as was proposed by
Mr. Ogilvie, to protect the author against unfair treatment in
respect to future royalties.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class="sc">Washington, D.C.</span>, <i>June 8, 1906</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman of the Joint Committee on Patents of the Senate
and House of Representatives</span>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>: At the meeting of the Joint committee held to-day,
counsel representing one of the talking machine companies made a
statement to the effect that Hon. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of
Congress, in the preparation of the copyright bill had called into
conference only such interests as he wanted, and with whom he was
in league, and intimated that the Librarian has acted in an unfair
manner.
</p>

<p>
When recess was taken and the gentleman was leaving the building, I
called him aside and emphatically took exception to the remarks
referred to. As one attending but not participating in the last two
conferences held, I think it no more than fair and just and my duty
to express to the joint committee the fact that Mr. Putnam's course
throughout the conferences was fair, just, and equitable to all
interests represented, and that every interest concerned was
invited to present its views.
</p>

<p>
The interests were varied and frequently antagonistic, and Mr.
Putnam was decided in his expressions that every representative
should be heard to the fullest and freest extent, and that after
the wishes of those interested was ascertained he was confident an
equitable bill would be the outcome; that while it might not be
satisfactory in every respect to each, yet he felt positive that
with the assistance of the Department of Justice, the Treasury
Department, and the cooperation and counsel of the American Bar
Association, and the Bar Association of the City of New York, no
interest or line of industry, whether represented or not, would be
unjustly or unfairly treated. His attitude in all of the
conferences was in the highest degree dignified and impartial.
</p>

<p>
To my positive knowledge the trade journals, as well as the
newspapers, contained full information concerning the copyright
conferences and the proposed copyright bill as long ago as
February, 1906; yet the gentleman referred to claims that the
conferences were star chamber proceedings for the benefit of
selected private interests. No interested concern could have failed
to become acquainted with the fact that the conferences were being
held, and no one seeking admission was denied opportunity to
present his views.
</p>

<p>
This statement is made solely for the reason that the unjust,
unfair, and undeserved criticism of Mr. Putnam, known to me to be
absolutely true, has stirred my deepest indignation, and I present
this protest to the committee and ask that the reflections upon Mr.
Putnam be stricken from the record.

Sincerely, yours,

STATEMENT OF FREDERICK W. HEDGELAND, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Whom do you represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hedgeland</span>. I represent the Kimball Company.
</p>

<p>
I wish to state, gentlemen, that three or four days ago I first learned
of the introduction of this measure. I have heard what the advocates of
this bill have said with reference to there being one side to this
question. There are really four sides to this question&mdash;the public, the
composer, the manufacturers of the automatic musical instruments, and
the inventors that have made that industry possible.
</p>

<p>
The bill as drawn practically gives the monopoly of all this capital
that has been invested, the genius that has been displayed and made
this field possible to the composer, to the publisher and composer, in
its entirety. Now, the brains and effort that have made this market
open to the publisher should be recognized in this bill. The bill
should not be a retroactive one, to punish the inventor and the
capitalist for what they have done in the past to provide a field for
the composer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It will not be retroactive.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hedgeland</span>. It must be equitable; and as to any rights that
are conveyed in that bill to the publisher or the composer, it must put
these industries on an equal footing. Otherwise it is creating one of
the worst features of trusts that one can conceive of.
</p>

<p>
In a recent suit it has been claimed that these instruments discourage
education in music. Such is not the case. In a recent test case it was
proven and never contradicted that learning, both vocal and
instrumental, has increased year after year, and that the sale of these
staff notation copies has been increased rather than diminished by the
automatic musical instruments. Now, those things all being taken into
consideration, I think this industry deserves very careful equitable
consideration on your part.
</p>

<p>
I have had no time to prepare the different phases of this matter, and
would like, if the committee will give me permission, to file a short
brief from the manufacturers' and inventors' standpoint.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You may have that privilege.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Hedgeland</span>. With that, gentlemen, I will not take any more
of your time.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>To the joint committee of the Senate and House</i>:
</p>

<p>
In obedience to the privilege extended me on my short address June
9 by your honorable committee I now file the following brief:
</p>

<p>
There are, without question, four vital interests involved in the
copyright legislation now before your committee, as applying to
mechanical reproductions of musical compositions, as set forth
specifically in section 1, paragraph (g), and section 38; this
bill, H.R. 19853, also bristles in many sections with conditions
that might easily be construed as applying to mechanical industry,
and calls for careful analytical legal investigation.
</p>

<p>
The interests of equity involved are: The inventor; the composer;
the manufacturer of automatic instruments and their controllers;
the public. I shall take up the equities in the order named.
</p>

<p>
<i>The inventor.</i>&mdash;Being an inventor, and the majority of my
inventions being on automatic musical instruments and devices for
making the controllers (which patents largely outnumber any
contributed by any other individual to this art), I am well fitted
to state the part these devices have taken in the advancement of
music. Automatic musical instruments date back six decades or over.
The barrel organ, with its cylinder and pins, was used to accompany
divine worship in English churches before pianos adorned the homes
of the congregation, and they have been constantly manufactured up
to the present time, and are known now as orchestrions.
Twenty-three years ago, at the inventions exhibition held in
London, England, automatic reed organs (Æolians) were exhibited by
the Mechanical Organette Company, of New York, and, mechanically, I
had charge of the instruments on exhibition. There were also
exhibited piano players of French and German manufacture and the
Miranda pianista, an English pneumatic player. Both Æolians and
piano players have constantly been manufactured up to the present
time, inventive genius constantly laboring for perfection in
operation, ease of operation, and reduction of cost to place them
in reach of the masses. It is a fact beyond dispute that barrel
organs are as old as or older than pianos or reed organs.
</p>

<p>
I have labored twenty-three years in this industry and contributed
between thirty and forty patents to the automatic-instrument
industry, and have invented and patented machines that would record
on controllers for automatic musical instruments the conceptions of
pianists and authors, when played on an instrument by them, and I
have yet to acquire a competency for my labors. The inventor's
labors are always discounted by the following conditions:
</p>

<p>
First. Capital and machinery to market and manufacture the
invention.
</p>

<p>
Second. State of the prior art as brought out in the Patent Office
search.
</p>

<p>
Third. The liability of infringement and the slow and tedious and
expensive process of stopping it, taking testimony from Maine to
California, etc. I have a case of flagrant infringement which was
prosecuted four years ago and has not yet been adjudged by the
circuit court&mdash;as is usual in such cases, temporary injunction
being denied, which the composer or author could and does readily
obtain.
</p>

<p>
<i>The composer.</i>&mdash;The composer or author of musical
compositions rarely, if ever, follows composing or copyrighting
alone as the means of making a livelihood. In all my experience I
can not recall a single instance where this has been the case. With
practically no exceptions, the composers of musical compositions
are engaged in various other walks of life, and this line of work
is more or less incidental to the occupations they follow. As an
illustration I will name a few of them: Band masters, professional
pianists, organists, choir leaders, teachers of music, piano
salesmen, music salesmen, and many other callings. The amount of
time or application spent in framing musical compositions is
oftentimes but a few hours and in the majority of cases in
otherwise idle hours. For instance, the testimony of George
Schleiffarth, given under oath, which appears later in this brief.
He states: "I have composed 1,500 pieces in thirty-seven years and
have netted only $5,000 for these thirty-odd years." This is an
average earning of $3.33 for each piece he copyrighted, or a yearly
income during these thirty-seven years of $135 per year from his
copyrights. It is patent to anyone that he did not procure his
livelihood by this means. This is not an exceptional case, but
rather a fair average of them.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe a single case can be produced where a musical
composer has earned a livelihood by his compositions alone. This is
a very different case with the author of a book with whom the
composer shares like privileges under the copyright act. In the
majority of cases the author follows writing as his only means of
livelihood. This class of work occupies a great deal of time,
expense, travel, and study of the subjects forming the foundation
of his work. The composers rarely treat their compositions as a
serious business proposition, but rather as a side issue of net
gain on what they realize from them. The publishers of the country
are banded and organized together for mutual protection and
enrichment to profit by this condition at the expense of the
composer, the policy to fight royalties in favor of outright
purchases for nominal amounts being general.
</p>

<p>
<i>The manufacturer of automatic musical instruments and their
controllers.</i>&mdash;The equitable interest of the automatic
instrument manufacturer consists really of two classes, namely,
their rights as legitimate manufacturers to a self-made industry;
and the part they have taken in the musical education of mankind,
and the right they have to continue uninterrupted in an industry
and art in which they have been so potent a factor, without
molestation.
</p>

<p>
First. All manufacturers of automatic musical instruments or their
controllers have vast interests involved. Capital and time have
been heavily spent in creating an honest, legitimate and, beyond
question, legal business. They have acquired patent rights, built
at large expense special machinery to make a more perfect and less
costly product. In short, have exercised and exhibited the same
ambition and enterprise that is put into any business where price
and merit is the determining factor of success.
</p>

<p>
Second. The manufacturer of self-playing instruments has done much
to extend and create cultivated musical taste in the community.
</p>

<p>
This has at no time been at the expense of the composer, but, to
the contrary, has increased not only the sale of sheet music but
has not diminished the study of music, as the following witnesses
testified under oath in the recent copyright case: White Smith
Music Publishing Company <i>v.</i> Apollo Company, which testimony
was never rebutted or disputed as to fact.
</p>

<p>
Mr. George Schleiffarth, witness called on behalf of defendant,
being duly sworn, testified as follows:
</p>

<p>
"I have been writing music for thirty-seven years. I have written
about fifteen hundred copyrighted compositions, several comic
operas, and innumerable musical sketches of all sorts. I have also
published some music personally and have now compositions with
nearly all the leading publishers in the United States. My
best-known compositions are 'Doris,' 'Ambolena Snow,' 'Douglas Club
Two-step,' 'Who Will Buy My Roses Red?' and the comic opera
'Rosita,' which has been playing for about twelve years, <span class="asterisk">* * *</span> and
as the composer is anxious to be known, I have often asked my
publishers to allow the reproduction of my compositions on
graphophones and self-playing devices.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 5. Is it your actual observation that the demand for the sheet
music is created and stimulated so that the sale thereof is
increased by having the musical compositions played by the piano
players and other self-playing instruments, and that the cutting of
the perforated rolls for a given musical composition and the
selling of such rolls with and for the piano players does increase
the demand for the sheet music?&mdash;A. As I am not in the sheet
business on such a scale that I could judge to what extent it has
increased, I still claim, from knowing the amount of music sold in
the United States to-day, especially in the popular composition
line, it is stimulated by all self-playing devices. For example, I
would sit at a piano player and play a catchy melody; six or eight
people standing around me will immediately ask&mdash;or some of them
will&mdash;'What is this tune you are playing?' and I know from personal
knowledge that many copies, especially of my own compositions,
which are cut for self-players, have been bought in sheet-music
form on account of my playing them on the machine.
</p>

<p class="testimony">
"Redirect:
</p>

<p>
"Q. 22. I inferred from your statements in that regard that you
received usually what you regard as very small compensation or
price for a great many of your compositions thus sold. Will you
give some instances of this sort, illustrating the disparity
between the price you received and the popularity, in sales, of the
pieces respectively?&mdash;A. My first great success, 'Careless
Elegance," which I published on royalty twenty-eight years ago, and
which is still selling to-day, netted me $11. My great song, 'Who
Will Buy My Roses Red?' which sold 100,000 copies, netted me $83.
My great composition, 'The World's Exposition March,' $5. 'The
Cadet Two-step' (50,000 copies sold), $4. And so I may go on ad
infinitum. Out of 1,500 compositions I have probably earned
$5,000."
</p>

<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"<span class="sc">Peter C. Lutkin</span>, witness called on behalf of the
defendant, being duly sworn, testified as follows:
</p>

<p>
"Q. 4. Have you in mind the rate of growth in respect to pupils in
attendance in the school of music for which you are dean, for five
or six years back; and if so, will you kindly give us the facts in
general?&mdash;A. I have the statistics for the past five years. The
attendance in the school of music for the year 1898-99 was 248; for
the next year, 297; the next, 348; for the next, 366; for the
present year, 460. The figures for the present year are an
underestimate rather than an overestimate, as the year is not yet
closed; actual number is 453 to date, but will probably run to 475.
</p>

<p>
"No cross examination."

"<span class="sc">Julius W. Peters</span>, a witness called on behalf of the
defendant company, being sworn, deposes and testifies as follows:
</p>

<p class="testimony">
"Direct examination by Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>:
</p>

<p>
"Q. 1. Please state your name, age, residence, and occupation.&mdash;A.
Julius W. Peters; age, 45; residence, 4465 Oakenwald avenue,
Chicago, Ill.; bookkeeper for Chicago Musical College.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 2. In your capacity of such bookkeeper, have you been intrusted
with the keeping of the attendance of that institution?&mdash;A. I have.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 3. Will you please state what those records show as to the rate
of growth of the attendance of pupils at that institution during
recent years, giving, if you can do so, the rate from year to year,
down to the current year?&mdash;A. I have taken this report from the
year 1896-97, and our years run from September to September, The
increase from 1896-97 to 1897-98 over the preceding year was 9.6
per cent, in the following year 10 per cent, in the next year 10
per cent, in the next 23&frac34; per cent, and in the next year 12.9
per cent.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 4. Can you give, from the indications so far in this year, the
approximate rate of increase?&mdash;A. I should say it would be at least
as much as last year, which was approximately 13 per cent.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 5. What is the total increase in attendance from the first year
of which you have stated the figures, to the present time?&mdash;A. 75.3
per cent; that is, up to September, 1902.
</p>

<p>
"No cross-examination."

"Direct examination by Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>:
</p>

<p>
"Q. 1. Please state your name, age, residence, and occupation.&mdash;A.
William McKinley; 41; 3306 Indiana avenue, Chicago, Ill.; music
publisher.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 6. During the period, say, for the past three years, during
which the manufacture and sale of these automatic players has been
most rapidly increasing, what has been the fact with regard to the
sales of sheet music, as to growth or diminution?&mdash;A. My business
has greatly increased.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 7. If you have made any examination with regard to the
compositions which have been cut in perforated rolls and used in
automatic players by the different companies making such players,
as to the sales which have been made of these pieces in sheet-music
form during the period, say of the last three or four years, or
since the time when they were cut in perforated rolls, will you
state how the sales of such pieces have run? Have they increased or
decreased during those years?&mdash;A. My business has very greatly
increased in certain pieces that I know are issued in the form of a
perforated roll.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 8. Have you in mind&mdash;if so, you may state as near as you
recall&mdash;the rate of increase of any number of those which you have
looked up and remember, giving their titles, if you recall them;
and, if not, in general?&mdash;A. The sales of some of the pieces have
doubled within the last two years&mdash;double what they were for the
four years previous. I have traced up about 20 pieces of that sort
to get these figures from which I stated the comparison above. I
know when I desire to get new music for my family I call on the
operator or performer of some of the stores that handle the music
rolls. They often give me a list of the pieces. I usually purchase
that. I have a list in my pocket of perhaps at least 20 pieces that
I have been recommended to purchase. They have been recommended to
me by one of the young men who has charge of that department&mdash;music
rolls&mdash;in one of the stores; pieces I had never heard before.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 9. I understand you mean by your last statement that the pieces
that you are recommended to purchase are so recommended by persons
who have opportunity to hear them played by means of the perforated
rolls?&mdash;A. Yes, sir.

</p>

<p>
"Q. 1. Please state your name, age, residence, and occupation.&mdash;A.
Walter Lutz; 29 years; 902 North Halstead street, Chicago, Ill.;
salesman with H. B. McCoy in the music business, Chicago.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 2. How long have you been employed as music salesman?&mdash;A.
Sixteen years.
</p>

<p>
"Q. 3. From your experience as a salesman of sheet music, have you
had any opportunity or occasion to judge what effect, if any, the
introduction and increasing use of the piano players and other
automatic instruments of this class has upon the demand for and
sale of the sheet music of the same compositions?&mdash;A. Yes; I have
had people come in the store and ask for music which they had heard
from the various players.
</p>

<p>
"No cross-examination."
</p>

<p>
I wish to call the committee's attention to the fact that the above
testimony was taken to prove the opinions expressed by two
witnesses for the plaintiffs were in error when they stated as
their opinion that the mechanical player was detrimental to the
sale of sheet music. Note the lawyers for the White Smith Music
Publishing Company did not dispute the facts by not cross-examining
these witnesses. The plaintiff is a big music publishing house and
influential members of the Music Publishers' Association, with all
the evidence and aid their association could lend, could not and
did not attack these undisputable facts. It is a coincident worthy
of your close attention that W. M. Bacon, a partner in the
plaintiff's firm in this case and also of the copyright committee
of the Music Publishers' Association, who was leader of the
prosecuting forces and signally failed to prove that this industry
did other than to improve the sale of music, now comes to your
committee with a copyright measure framed by his associate on the
copyright committee of his association.
</p>

<p>
Mr. G. W. Furniss, who is chairman, presented it and had it drafted
in at the first conference, at which they both were present, and
they were at every other conference to guard their conspiracy;
conspiracy I say, because Mr. Bacon's firm has a contract (and his
lawyers had to so stipulate), identical to the contract filed with
your committee, between a publisher and the Æolian Company. Read
the contract; they have conspired against the composer and against
the public for an undue personal gain, grafted what they wanted in
their copyright measure, and now come to you gentlemen with it
under the guise that the composer is being robbed of his dues by
automatic devices. I submit it is a prima facie case of the
principals to this contract not only planning to sweat the
composer, but to hold up the public. It is a conspiracy in which
the copyright office has aided them, possibly innocently, and they
have asked your assistance, the public funds paying the expenses,
the same public they want to get under their grasp. I can prove
every word of this at any time. Is it not time Uncle Sam should
arouse?
</p>

<p>
<i>The public.</i>&mdash;The public side of this question is an
important one. They have purchased in good faith instruments and
self-playing devices and invested their money on the reasonable
assurance of being able to continue undisturbed in these rights,
and, by their patronage, have helped develop one of the foremost
industries of this country and must be permitted to continue to buy
controllers from the different manufacturers of their instruments.
The public's spending power in this industry, being the foundation
of this great and prosperous industry and the foundation on which
compensation is now sought by copyright legislation for the
composer, it is obvious that it must not be impaired at this late
date by any measure calculated to give either the composer or his
publishers legislation that will place either of them in a position
to dominate this extensive industry and interests, and the public.
</p>


<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
PERTINENT POINTS OF FACT.
</p>

<p>
This bill, H.R. 19853, as presented, is an iniquitous measure,
framed not by the "poor composer" nor by the public interested, but
by banded, bonded interests, which have conspired together for
special privileges and greed and have had the audacity to submit it
to Congress for its seal of approval. There is no secret now about
this. The Librarian's records show, as also his admissions, that
the interests I have enumerated in this brief were never notified
of intended proceedings and never invited, although these uninvited
interests are the very ones bartered in in the bill. The conferees
at the conference consisted of the Book Publishers' Association,
the Music Publishers' Association, etc. The two mentioned could
hardly represent the authors and composers. Have they any
credentials to this effect? The facts are, they represent
copyrights they own and for which they seek further favorable
concessions, out of which the exploited beneficiaries, the
composers, would get nothing.
</p>

<p>
It had been maintained that mechanical players tend to discourage
learning and reduce the sale of copyright music, but all the
evidence taken on this subject proves the contrary is the case, and
it was never questioned, even by counsel representing the
publishers, who now seek special privileges. The publishers can not
prove that they have paid an average of 1 per cent on copyright
music they have published, nor the composers that they have earned
an average of 1 per cent on their copyrights, in an industrial
field of their own, yet they ask legislation giving them a
dominating interest in an industry that other brains and money have
created. Any amendment to this measure placing all interests on an
equitable footing will be fought by its advocates, showing their
corrupt intentions. This industry has been hampered for past years
by threats of the mentioned combinations, and Congress in any new
bill should clearly define whether this mechanical matter is or is
not included in the amendment. To end this matter once and for all,
I am in favor of giving the composers (not the proprietor or owner
of a copyright) the specific right to copyright his composition as
applied to mechanical reproductions, and to collect reasonable
royalties from manufacturers who may wish to use it, leaving it to
a court of equity to determine what a reasonable equity would be,
if such a measure is considered advisable. I should urge that, as
this provision will apply solely to mechanical reproductions and
receive its benefits therefrom, the term of this copyright should,
in all equity, take the life of a patent with which it associates.
</p>

<p>
The following parallel ethical equities with the case of the
composer might well be considered by the committee:
</p>

<p>
The architect, the man of brains, who conceives a wonderful
conception of a piece of architecture or arrangement of a building,
how can he prevent anyone else from duplicating this result or
building it, which is the creation of his conception and work? A
man discovers a treatment for some disease; others use it and apply
it. A surgeon discovers a new form of operation; the others use it.
A business man, by dint of his brain, figures out a great system
for running his business, which makes it immensely profitable; his
fellow-beings adopt it and don't pay him a cent. There are hundreds
of parallel cases. Gentlemen, if it had not been for this gigantic
conspiracy you would not have heard of the composer's woes.
</p>

<p>
This amendment has been fathered throughout by publishers,
associations, and rings. They have exploited the composers'
interests when they do not represent them, but, instead, their own
selfish interests, which have been safeguarded in advance by
contract.
</p>

<p>
Any legislation in favor of the oppressed composer should be so
worded and framed as to not place him any further under the power
of these combinations.
</p>

<p>
I shall be pleased, at any time, to prove to your honorable
committee any statements made in this brief.

STATEMENT OF CHARLES S. BURTON, ESQ., OF CHICAGO, ILL.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Whom do you represent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. I speak for the manufacturers of the perforated
rolls and automatic instruments.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. How much time do you wish?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. I do not know how much time the committee has at
its disposal nor what has transpired. It may appear that some of the
points on which I wish to speak have already been handled, and if I am
informed of that as I touch them I will not take up further time with
them. As I say, I speak for the manufacturers of perforated rolls and
automatic instruments.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. We have had several speakers on that subject.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. I understand that some points have been presented.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. Perhaps it would answer your purpose to be
permitted to see what they have said and supply in writing any
additions you may desire to make.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. I should be very glad to do so. I have been
obliged to come here on the shortest possible notice. I left my desk
with my mail half opened and jumped for a train upon a telegraphic
request to be here, and have only had that much time to determine just
the form in which I would like to present what I have to say. But I
could give you in ten minutes, probably, the results which, it seems to
me, the bill should accomplish, and if I touch on points that have
already been discussed it will not be necessary to speak further on
them.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Chairman</span>. You may have ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. But I would like to take advantage of the
permission to file a full brief, giving my suggestions in detail as to
the changes which, it seems to me, ought to be made in the bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Of course we want that, Mr. Burton. We think that
will be more valuable to the committee than a speech.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. That is what I wanted to present, and if I had had
time I should have been glad to have brought it in that form here.
</p>

<p>
I want to say first that it seems to me that while the bill follows the
previous statutes in general in respect to copyrights, in the point I
am going to speak of it ought to be amended. The practice in respect of
patents is that the inventor shall verify his inventorship; he shall
make oath that he believes himself to be the inventor, and any rights
that pass to an assignee of the inventor must pass by an instrument
which can be placed of record, signed by the inventor. But on the
contrary, in the case of copyrights, in order to obtain a copyright the
person claiming as the proprietor has merely to come in and make the
claim as proprietor. He does not even have to verify that; and
thereupon this bill expressly provides that he has a prima facie title
to the copyright thus obtained.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that that opens the door, as it always has&mdash;there is
nothing new in this bill in that respect&mdash;to a large amount of fraud
upon the author or whoever is the one in whom the right originates. I
think, therefore, that when the bill is made up it should require the
author to verify his authorship. The bill should provide that the
application for registration should be accompanied by an affidavit of
authorship, and if application is made on behalf of an assignee as
proprietor there should be an instrument conveying the right from the
person who originates it, namely, the author, accompanying the
petition. It seems to me that no hardship can arise from requiring this
of an author and the assignee of an author, as it is required of an
inventor and the assignee of an inventor.
</p>

<p>
The bill provides that there shall be a very careful prima facie case
made by affidavit as to the printing and preparation of the mechanical
material for publication in order to come within the statute. All that
must be verified, but the fundamental authorship requisite goes upon a
mere assertion, without even the verification of an oath of the party
claiming. A change should be made in that respect.
</p>

<p>
Then, furthermore, with regard to the right respecting perforated
rolls, in respect of which I am speaking particularly, I think the
right should be entirely distinct and separate from the fundamental
copyright, the copyright of the "work," using the term that has been
used; that the right to the perforated roll or whatever other form of
mechanical reproduction is claimed should be based upon the filing of a
copy of that perforated roll; that the filing of the copy of the
original work should carry the copyright in the common sense of the
word, but if the author desires to claim copyright in a perforated roll
on his work, for that purpose, if you please to put it so, he should
take it for that purpose, and make his claim of copyright upon that
roll. If he wishes it in any other form of reproduction, such as the
disk of the talking machine, he should file that; and I think that
right should be entirely separate from the right which might pass by an
assignment of the copyright. The publisher who may acquire the
copyright on the work from the author should not, without express
conveyance (although the same person might acquire both) acquire the
right to control the perforated roll or the phonograph record or the
talking-machine disk; they should be entirely separate.
</p>

<p>
The bill does provide that these shall be regarded as separate estates;
but in view of the decisions in which a similar phrase is used, it is
clear to me that that means that when the copyright has been obtained
by the one proceeding provided for here, all these elements of it are
separate estates which might be passed by separate assignments, but
they would all be contained in the one copyright. I think that is
wrong. I think that the right for the perforated roll should be
acquired by filing a copy of that roll, in order that the public may
know just exactly what is claimed, and whether it is claimed or not,
and whether it is to be utilized.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, I think that is a right that is naturally distinct from
the other. It is a right that goes into manufacture instead of into
publication. It is not to be done by the same people, naturally. The
manufacturer, having a factory, makes the perforated roll. The
publisher makes the books in an entirely different way. The two things
are like different lines of trade. They are not naturally blended,
either in use or sale. And therefore the composer or author, whichever
it be, a work of words or of music, should be entitled to handle it
entirely himself, apart from any right that he may have passed to the
publisher by the transfer of his copyright.
</p>

<p>
I think I overheard as I came in a remark indicating that the next
point I desire to press has already been suggested. In section 3 of the
bill as I read it, as it stands now, there is a provision which would
make it possible (and the committee will interrupt me if it has already
been discussed, for in that event I should not wish to spend any time
upon it) for the owners of copyrights of existing music to simply
refile that music for copyright under this statute, and publish it with
the mark that is required by this bill, and thereupon all that was
contained in the previous copyright that is contained in that refiled
and recopyrighted matter would come under this act, with all the
privileges that this act gives over former copyright acts.
</p>

<p>
For example, this very matter of the right to mechanically reproduce
would attach to a piece of music which had been previously copyrighted
and of which a copy is now filed under this statute, and all the
privileges of the bill except the longer term would attach to old
copyrighted music which is simply refiled. So it would be possible to
make the provisions of this act retroactive, so that the publishers,
upon taking this proceeding, for 50 cents, with all their copyrighted
music, would immediately cause the loss of the millions of dollars that
have been invested in those rolls.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That has been discussed by several gentlemen, and
objection taken to it&mdash;the same objection you are discussing now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. Very well; I will not talk of that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. His point is that he would let the copyright go to
each one of these interests, as I understand it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That is on another point, however. He is speaking
about section 3 now, in reference to subsisting copyrights.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. In section 3 there is a provision which ought to
be changed to prevent the subsisting copyright from carrying over these
provisions into the new&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. That has been discussed by several gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. Then if you are not going to make it
retroactive&mdash;I judge the committee is clear upon that point&mdash;so as to
bring under a copyright and make infringements all these outstanding
millions of rolls, the question next should be, Should it be possible
for the composer, by copyrighting now his perforated roll or taking any
steps under this statute, to have the right from this time on to
control the cutting of music which has heretofore been cut?
</p>

<p>
That strikes one at once with a little semblance of justice; but the
injustice of that proposition consists in this: That for every piece of
music which has been cut by a manufacturer, that has been lawfully cut
under the present decisions, where he has a perfect right to do it, he
has been obliged to expend from $10 to $25. He has that much investment
lying under this music that is out in the market. Now, if it is not
reasonable that all this outstanding music, lawfully made and lawfully
sold, should become outlawed by a new act, is it reasonable that all
this provision for making that investment, which amounts to millions of
dollars, in the preparation for cutting this music, should become
outlawed immediately, so that no more compensation can come to this
manufacturer who has this $25 or this $10 invested in each piece, and
say to him: "You can not use that music; you can not cut any more of
that music?" Is it reasonable that that investment should be
killed&mdash;that that investment, lawfully made, in a lawful product,
should become immediately unlawful and waste paper?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. What section has that effect?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. I do not say the bill would certainly have that
effect. It is entirely uncertain, but it seems to me the bill would
have the effect, as I read it, of permitting the composer to claim the
rights except as to outstanding music&mdash;that is, the right from this
time on to cut it. The bill should be clear. I have had only a very
short time to examine it, and a provision may possibly lurk somewhere
under which the continued production of perforated rolls now being
produced would be permitted, but I think not. I think it is possible,
or might be held possible, under the bill for the composer to claim the
rights from this time on to cut the music.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. Oh, very clearly so; he can sell that right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. If that is the case, it seems to me unjust.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span>. Where the copyright has run out?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. No; for copyrights taken out after the passage of
this bill.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. I am talking about the music that is now on the
market, not the rolls, but the means of cutting them&mdash;whether the
composer can, under this bill, acquire the right to stop the cutting
from now on of that music.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. I do not think you need to take any time with
that proposition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. If that is clear, I will pass it. It seems to me
the bill gives it; but if you make it entirely clear that it does
not&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. It is not the purpose of the committee, I judge,
to allow that. Your time has expired.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. Then I will ask leave to file a complete brief
suggesting changes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Currier</span>. And I might say to you what has been said to
others here&mdash;that neither the Senate nor the House committee will take
any action on this bill at this session. It will go over until next
winter, and at any time before action is taken you can file any further
brief or any further suggestions with the committee.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burton</span>. I thank the committee on behalf of the interests I
represent.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>To the Senate and House Committees on Patents</i>:
</p>

<p>
Pursuant to the permission granted me at the conclusion of the few
minutes' oral hearing with which I was favored before the joint
meeting of your committees, I beg to submit herewith a brief and
suggestions with respect to the amendments to Senate bill 6330 and
House bill 19853, deemed proper and necessary in order to make the
act contained in said bills properly protective of the rights and
conservative of the interests arising out of and connected with the
industries of automatic musical instruments and controlling
devices&mdash;perforated rolls, talking-machine disks, and phonograph
cylinders&mdash;for the same.
</p>

<p>
All of which is respectfully submitted.
</p>

<p>
The following facts should be taken into consideration in making
any amendment to the copyright law affecting automatic reproducing
devices as well as perforated rolls for reproducing music,
talking-machine disks, and phonograph cylinders for their
respective purposes.
</p>

<p>
1. To the modern arts relating to automatic music-playing devices
and automatic means for reproducing sound, such as talking machines
and graphophones, authors and music composers have contributed not
a single iota.
</p>

<p>
These arts have been the result of the combined efforts of
thousands of scientific, industrious, and artistic inventors. These
inventors and the manufacturers cooperating with them by their
capital and business skill and enterprise have created these entire
arts and to them is due the entire benefit which the public has
derived and is deriving from these arts.
</p>

<p>
2. Musical composers and song writers, notwithstanding their entire
lack of participation in the creation and development of these
arts, have derived already and are still deriving large pecuniary
benefit from them.
</p>

<p>
This is most clearly provable in respect to musical compositions.
For any musical composition which has been largely reproduced by
automatic players employing perforated roll controllers a largely
increased demand immediately arises. The sale of the ordinary staff
notation of any such composition experiences a notable stimulus
immediately upon the production and sale of the perforated rolls
for producing the composition automatically upon musical
instruments.
</p>

<p>
This fact is conclusively established by the record in the suit of
Apollo <i>v.</i> White-Smith Music Publishing Company, lately
determined in the United States circuit court of appeals in the
eastern division of the southern district of New York. We are
filing herewith a copy of the printed record of the defendant in
that suit, having marked the pages<a href="#note1" name="noteref1" class="fnanchor"><small>[1]</small></a> containing the testimony upon
this point, and also a copy of the brief on behalf of the defendant
citing<a href="#note2" name="noteref2" class="fnanchor"><small>[2]</small></a> the facts as established by the record upon both sides to
the effect that in the face of the testimony by wholesale and
retail dealers in sheet music, that the sale of perforated rolls
for such music largely and promptly increased the demand for the
sheet music, there was offered not one word of testimony to the
contrary, although in the control of the complainants and available
as witnesses in their behalf&mdash;practically as cocomplainants or
cobeneficiaries with them in the suit&mdash;were included nearly all the
large publishers of and dealers in sheet music, whose records of
sales would have established the facts one way or the other
overwhelmingly, so that the absence of testimony from these sources
must be taken as an admission of the fact as testified to by the
few publishers who were accessible to the defendants.
</p>

<p class="foot">
<a name="note1">&nbsp;</a>
<a href="#noteref1"><small>[1]</small></a> Schleiffarth, pp. 48-51; McKinley, pp. 97-100; Lutz, pp.

</p>

<p class="foot">
<a name="note2">&nbsp;</a>
<a href="#noteref2"><small>[2]</small></a> Pp. 29-34.
</p>

<p>
We assert, and challenge contradiction, that the experience and
observation of the music trade during the past ten years, during
which this art has grown from infancy to its present proportions,
establishes the proposition, viz, that the sale of perforated rolls
and other means for automatically reproducing musical compositions
to the ear tends largely to increase the demand for the ordinary
staff notation or other published form of the particular
compositions which are thus reproduced.
</p>

<p>
3. The making of a perforated roll or equivalent device or
appliance for reproducing to the ear a musical composition is not a
mere mechanical process nor one involving mere mechanical skill. It
is, on the contrary, an artistic process requiring musical taste
and ability and affording opportunity for the exercise of the very
highest musical taste and ability, conjoined with the most exact
and delicate understanding of the mechanical principles and
features of the mechanism with which the controller
device&mdash;perforated roll or the like&mdash;is designed to cooperate for
reproducing the music to the ear. The art of the "arranger," as he
is termed, of a perforated roll brings into exercise an artistic
sense and skill of as high a rank as that of the musical composer
and requires, in addition thereto, an ability to understand
accurately and minutely the intricate mechanism to which the device
produced must correspond and with which it must cooperate.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the talking-machine disk and phonograph cylinder,
the contribution of the singer and player is even more obvious, as
the essential and controlling element in the value of the devices
which result and which are the distinct product of the art of the
singer and player is a thing apart from the art of the composer.
</p>

<p>
The producer of a perforated roll or of a talking machine disk or
phonograph cylinder, therefore, is as much entitled to be
considered an "author" in virtue of the production of such roll,
disk, or cylinder, entirely apart from and subsequent to the
composition of the music as is the painter by virtue of his
sensitive appreciation of beauties of form and color in nature and
his skill in reproducing them upon the canvas. The landscape
painter does not create the nature scene, but he is not the less an
artist because he depicts it only, instead of creating it from his
imagination. Nor is he less entitled to a copyright upon his
painting, because it is a more or less perfect reproduction to the
eye of that which existed for the eye before he reproduced it, than
if he had evolved the scene from his imagination and then depicted
it to the eye by the same skill.
</p>

<p>
The photographer who merely posed his subject is entitled to a
copyright upon his photograph. He did not cast the features, nor
shape the form, nor arrange the hair, nor devise the costume. He
merely posed them all, and chose the position with respect to light
and shadow, and adjusted the contrivances for affecting both. This
was his art, and the photograph is the result; and it is his
photograph for purposes of copyright.
</p>

<p>
The "arranger" of the perforated roll is an artist of as high merit
as the photographer, and in some respects of as high merit as the
landscape painter.
</p>

<p>
If there is to be secured or conferred upon anyone an exclusive
right to the perforated roll, or to the talking-machine disk, or to
the phonograph cylinder, for producing to the ear a particular
composition, that right, in virtue of authorship, belongs to the
arranger of the perforated roll and to the singer or player who
produces the talking-machine disk or the phonograph cylinder.
</p>

<p>
That copyright may reasonably be granted to the producers of these
devices for the devices themselves seems too obvious for argument,
and that it should not be in the power of any composer whose
composition is published and on the market to discriminate between
different arrangers of perforated rolls or different singers or
players, in respect to the right of making such records,
respectively, and of selling or renting the same, seems also
obvious justice.
</p>

<p>
It would be no injustice, in view of the observed facts above
stated&mdash;that the composer derives benefit only and never injury
from the sale of these automatic devices&mdash;that he should have no
rights in respect to them, except to be credited with the
compositions by having them marked with the title which he has
given them for market and with his name as composer. But in view of
the possibility that there may be reciprocal advantage&mdash;that the
name and repute of the music and of its author may contribute to
the sale of the reproducing devices&mdash;a royalty for the use of the
title and name may reasonably be allowed to the composer.
</p>

<p>
But the composer should not be recognized as having any right
entitling him to prohibit anyone who desires to do so from making
such automatic reproducing devices by employing either the art of
the arranger of the perforated roll, or the voice of the singer, or
the skill of the player on musical instruments.
</p>

<p>
And the royalty should be uniform for all makers of each sort of
device; that is, all makers of perforated rolls for a given
composition should pay the same royalty to the composer for the use
of his name and the title of his music, and all makers of
vocalizing disks or cylinders should likewise pay the same royalty
for a given composition.
</p>

<p>
This right to royalty should be allowed, not in virtue of any
domination or supposed domination of the original copyright over
the act of reproduction, but solely in virtue of the natural right
of the composer to have his name and the title which he has given
to his music associated therewith, howsoever it is produced, and of
the fact that presumably a commercial value attaches to such name
and title, which will benefit the seller of the automatic
reproducing device.
</p>

<p>
This right of royalty should therefore not run to the proprietor of
the original copyright as such, but to the composer as such. If the
composer has sold his copyright the purchaser should not, by virtue
of that purchase, acquire any interest in the royalty of the
composer for the use of his name and the title of his music. Of
course the composer could sell this royalty right, and if he chose
to sell it with the copyright and to the same person he could do
so, but it should not pass without express mention. It should not
pass as incident or appertaining to the copyright.
</p>

<p>
Such a provision would be precisely like the provision in the
present statute with respect to translations. In the statute it is
now provided, not that the copyright includes the right of
translation, but that the author whose work has been copyrighted
has the exclusive right of translation. He may sell his copyright,
but such sale does not divest him of the monopoly of the
translation nor vest such monopoly of translation in the assignee
of his copyright.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;This point is somewhat fully developed in brief of
the defendants in White-Smith Music Publishing Company <i>v.</i>
Apollo, copy of which brief is herewith furnished. (See p. 46 to
50, inclusive.) The position above stated and presented in brief,
as above noted, was not controverted and was apparently fully
conceded as a legal proposition, by counsel for the complainants in
that suit. The ultimate propositions supported by the above
contention in that suit were contested upon other grounds. Copy of
complainants' brief upon this point will be furnished the committee
later, with citation to the particular paragraphs sustaining the
above statement.
</p>

<p>
Outside of and as an exception to the general class of musical
compositions to which the foregoing considerations are pertinent,
there is a class more closely related to automatic reproducing
devices and in respect to which the composer has a more vital
interest, viz:
</p>

<p>
Musical compositions not reproducible to the ear by a single human
performer upon any instrument, but which can be produced by means
of perforated rolls on an automatic instrument.
</p>

<p>
The staff notations of such compositions have practically no market
value, except in case they are arranged in the forms of orchestral
scores, so as to be produced by a plurality of instruments
simultaneously played by different performers. The number of copies
of such orchestral scores which will be required is necessarily
very limited, and the sale of such staff notations offers a very
limited field from which the composer may derive a just
compensation for his work. The only source of revenue to the
composer of such works is in the sale of the only means of playing
these, viz, the perforated rolls.
</p>

<p>
It may be deemed proper and it will not be denied that it would be
just that a composer of a musical composition of this class who
causes it to be embodied in the form of perforated roll, and who
can derive a revenue from it practically only in this form, should
be considered in the light of both composer and arranger, and as
entitled to obtain original and independent copyright of the
perforated roll, so as to control the composition absolutely in
this form.
</p>

<p>
It is believed that it will not be difficult to frame a provision
of the statute to do justice to this class of composition, and
which shall not trench upon the natural equity of the perforated
roll arranger for other musical compositions, or upon the natural
right of the public to derive the use of the automatic reproducing
devices upon ordinary musical compositions, without requiring the
consent of or paying tribute to the composer.
</p>

<p>
<i>4. As to duration of copyright.</i>&mdash;The bill before your
committees proposes a remarkable extension of the period of
copyright beyond anything heretofore granted. This is believed to
be contrary to sound public policy and of doubtful
constitutionality.
</p>

<p>
The Constitution expressly limits the power of Congress in respect
to their copyright protection to granting such protection "for
limited periods." The term "limited" can have only a relative
meaning, and the obvious meaning is limited with respect to or in
comparison with the period during which the public will have desire
or use for the copyrighted work. It is contemplated, evidently,
that in compensation for the protection which the statute gives the
composer for a limited period the public shall derive the
unqualified use and benefit of the work for a remaining period. If
there is no remaining period, the consideration for the protection
has failed.
</p>

<p>
It needs no statistics to establish to the common knowledge of the
committee that not one book in ten thousand has any commercial
value fifty years after its publication. It will probably be safer
to say that not one published work in a hundred thousand has any
life after fifty years. If, therefore, the author is given the
monopoly for fifty years, the public has nothing left to compensate
it for that monopoly and protection.
</p>

<p>
Not one work in a million endures so as to have any value after one
hundred years.
</p>

<p>
But the bill proposes, as to the great bulk of copyrightable
matter, that the period of copyright shall be substantially one
hundred years&mdash;fifty years after the death of the author.
</p>

<p>
It is respectfully submitted that this transcends the intention of
the constitutional limitation, and that the public would, by such
an enactment, be deprived of substantially all the compensation
which the Constitution intended should be reserved to it in return
for the copyright protection granted the author.
</p>

<p>
Whether the constitutional limitation should or should not be so
strictly applied, it seems beyond doubt that sound public policy
forbids thus bartering away all the public benefit arising from the
free right of publication after the expiration of copyright.
</p>

<p>
There is a second objection to the particular form in which the
bill gives this extended copyright term. There does not appear to
be any logical relation between the copyright protection and the
duration of the life of the author. The privilege or protection
granted is in no respect personal, except as to the revenue which
may be derived.
</p>

<p>
There does not appear any reason why the work of a mature writer of
60, presumably capable of giving to the public compositions of
peculiar value, especially if they relate to scientific or
philosophical subjects, should receive less protection from his
copyright than would be granted to a youth of 20, whose immature
productions would obtain the protection of a presumably long life
before him (during which he would often regret his immature
publication).
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the particular form or provision of the bill with
respect to joint authors (line 24, p. 14; line 26, p. 15), when
corrected to cure the obvious error in the phraseology and express
the doubtless intended meaning, opens the way most obviously for
practical fraud upon the public. An aged author, by associating
with himself in a nominal yet unimpeachably colorable way a
youthful assistant, and obtaining copyright in their names as joint
authors, will secure protection for his work concurrent with the
life of the junior and fifty years thereafter, instead of
concurrently with his own nearly ended life and subsequent fifty
years.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that joint authorship will become exceedingly popular
if this paragraph of the bill is retained; and by the expedient of
triple or quadruple authorship the chances of a long period will be
greatly increased.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;The very obvious error above indicated&mdash;line 24,
page 14, line 2, page 15&mdash;has probably received the attention of
the committee. The sentence supplying the connection from the
commencement of section 18 now reads: "That the copyright secured
by this act shall endure <span class="asterisk">* * *</span> in the case of joint authors, during
their joint lives and for fifty years after the death of the last
survivor of them." The gap which is left between the dates of death
of the first and last dying of the joint authors is uncovered by
the copyright under this form of statement. That is, the copyright
would lapse upon the death of the first dying&mdash;the end of their
joint lives&mdash;and revive at the death of the last survivor. The
correction is obvious. Make the sentence read: "In the case of
joint authors, until the death of the last survivor of them and for
fifty years thereafter."
</p>

<p>
It is believed that the present term of copyright should not be
disturbed unless to shorten it. Twenty-eight years, with a possible
extension of fourteen, exceeds the actual life of a great majority
of copyrighted publications and leaves the public nothing for its
concession of temporary monopoly to the inventor; but it is,
perhaps, a fair average, and at least it has caused no serious
complaint upon either hand.
</p>

<p>
An exception should, however, be made in respect to any protection
which may be given to anyone, whether composer or arranger, with
respect to the automatic reproducing devices&mdash;such as perforated
rolls&mdash;associated so closely, as these devices necessarily are,
with manufacture as distinguished from publications and with
inventions as distinguished from literary or artistic works. The
duration of the patents, whose owners must pay tribute to the
holders of any form of copyright upon the perforated rolls, are
granted only seventeen years' monopoly in which to derive all
compensation for their inventions.
</p>

<p>
The copyright protection, if any, granted in any form upon
perforated rolls should not exceed the term of patents&mdash;seventeen
years.
</p>

<p>
<i>5. Verification of authorship and ownership should be
required.</i>&mdash;All our copyright laws hitherto have been
unaccountably lax in respect to the requirements for making prima
facie title to copyright by virtue of authorship or proprietorship.
It has only been necessary, and the present bill only makes it
necessary, that the applicant for registration under the copyright
statute should state, without verification of any sort, that he
claims as the author or proprietor, as the case may be. So
singularly loose is the requirement that the applicant is not even
required to declare that he is the author or proprietor, but only
to state that he claims as author.
</p>

<p>
How easily a fraudulently disposed claimant will satisfy his
conscience in stating that he claims as the author, when he might
hesitate to declare that he is, in fact, the author; and how much
more easily one who conceives that he has a shadow of right to
ownership will make the like statement that he claims as the
proprietor when he would hesitate to declare that in fact he is the
proprietor, is obvious without comment.
</p>

<p>
But it is certainly obvious that so vast and important a right as
that conferred by the copyright statute should not be vested and
given prima facie validity in anyone who has merely the effrontery
to declare even that he is the owner or that he is the proprietor.
</p>

<p>
Why should less be required of the claimant to copyright than is
required of the claimant to patent right?
</p>

<p>
The applicant for patent must make oath that he believes himself to
be the first and original inventor, and his oath must also declare
affirmatively the existence of all of the other conditions
precedent to his right to obtain a patent. Why should not the
author claiming copyright be subject to a similar requirement?
</p>

<p>
The assignee of an inventor desiring a patent to issue to himself
must file in the Patent Office an instrument in writing, signed by
the inventor, conveying to the assignee the whole or such portion
of the interest as it is desired to have appear in the name of the
assignee upon the issue of the patent, and must in addition
expressly request that the patent so issue to the assignee. Why
should less proof be required of one claiming copyright as
proprietor?
</p>

<p>
It seems that no argument is necessary to enforce these
suggestions. Under the present law and under the proposed bill any
publisher obtaining possession of an author's manuscript under any
color of right not involving him in larceny by reason of the
possession may proceed to put the work in print and make
application for copyright, not even averring that he is the
proprietor, but stating that he claims as proprietor. The copyright
certificate will issue, and his title to the copyright will be
prima facie established by the proceedings which he takes pursuant
to the statute and the action of the copyright office therein; and
the author, who may be ignorant of the proceedings, who may have
only entered upon negotiations with the publisher without any
intention of accepting the offers which may have been made, finds
himself in the position of being obliged to contest a prima facie
right on the part of the publisher to the copyright in his work,
with the alternative that if the publisher's title is not conceded
to be good the author's right is lost by publication.
</p>

<p>
How many authors have succumbed to the embarrassment of just this
situation, deliberately created by greedy publishers, will never be
known, but it is time that the statute which offers such inducement
to greedy human nature to perpetrate frauds of this character
should be remedied, and that the prima facie right acquired under
copyright statutes should have behind it at least the support of
the oath as to authorship and of an instrument of assignment by the
author to the party claiming as proprietor.
</p>

<p>
<i>6. Penal provisions.</i>&mdash;It is respectfully submitted that the
penal provisions of this statute are grossly disproportionate to
the offenses or injuries to which they are directed, and obviously
provocative of blackmail and coercion, and in some instances
clearly unconstitutional and unenforceable. No attempt will be made
here to discuss all of these provisions, but attention will be
directed only to those which bear upon the particular matter on
behalf of which this presentation is made, namely, automatic
reproducing devices; and without discussion it is suggested as too
obvious for argument that a penalty of $10 for each and every
infringing copy of a perforated roll found in the possession of the
alleged infringer, his agents or employees, is grossly excessive,
in view of the selling price of such rolls, which seldom exceeds
$3, and probably averages not far from $1.
</p>

<p>
Severe penalties are only proper where the offense complained of
can not be committed by accident or inadvertence, and where there
can be no possible mistake as to a given act constituting the
offense. In any case in which there might be room for difference of
opinion, or where the offense might be committed unwittingly, such
penalties are grossly improper.
</p>

<p>
But when the situation is such that the party entitled to complain
or who might allege injury by reason of the alleged offense is to
be the beneficiary of the penalty, and especially, as in the
present bill, is to absorb the entire penalty, it is obviously
contrary to reason and good morals to make the penalty materially
exceed the damage, because there is thereby created a motive on the
part of the person alleging injury to promote and encourage
surreptitiously the alleged offense until it has grown to large
proportions, so that he may thereby reap a greater benefit from the
trespass than he could possibly have reaped otherwise from the
property trespassed upon.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the perforated rolls, all these objections to severe
penalties are found concurrent, for&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) There will easily arise wide and honest difference of
opinion as to whether two given perforated rolls are infringements,
one of the other, and even whether a given perforated roll is an
infringement of a particular musical composition (if the bill
should be retained in such form as to make the original copyright
apply to perforated rolls). It is well known that controversies are
constantly arising upon the question of infringement as between two
staff notations, the second author often claiming and frequently
establishing, contrary to the belief of the first, that his
composition was an independent one, both having derived their theme
from sources in the public domain.
</p>

<p>
A perforated roll presenting a composition only so similar to a
public and copyrighted composition as to raise a question of
infringement if it were a staff notation, instead of a perforated
roll, will raise the same question as a perforated roll. The
copyright owner will reap an advantage, it may be, of 10 per cent,
upon the selling price of the sheet music, let us say 15 to 25
cents for every copy sold. He will reap a profit of $10 as a
minimum upon every copy which he can find in the possession of the
alleged infringer, his agents, or employees. Is there any doubt
which remedy he will elect? Is there any doubt that he will await
his opportunity for finding a large stock in the hands of the
alleged infringer? Is there any doubt that a statute so framed
would offer almost irresistible inducement to blackmail, which
might be perpetrated under such circumstances?
</p>

<p>
The extravagant injustice of the provisions for impounding the
"goods alleged to infringe" upon the commencement of a suit and for
delivering up for destruction all copies, as well as all plates,
molds, matrices, and other means for making infringing copies, have
been well discussed by Mr. Walker. It is not deemed conceivable
that your committee will seriously entertain such obviously
oppressive legislation. On what possible pretense of equity or
justice may a complainant, who thinks that his copyright has been
infringed, upon that mere allegation lock up his competitor's stock
of goods, while he on his part monopolizes the market during the
pendency of a long litigation to determine the justice of that
which may have been only a colorable charge at the start?
</p>

<p>
One's sense of justice is startled into horror at the suggestion of
subsection d, on page 18 of the bill, that "all plates, molds,
matrices, and other means for making infringing copies shall be
delivered up for destruction," even if it is understood that this
is to be done only at the conclusion of a suit. Whoever drafted
this provision was either malicious or ignorant. (This statement is
made with careful deliberation and we wish to repeat it: He was
either malicious or ignorant.) Mr. Walker's presentation must make
this clear. I make the same for my own client, which has an
equipment involving an investment of many thousand dollars for
producing perforated rolls, every element of which would enter into
the production of each single roll, and all of which would be
subject to destruction under the language quoted. Under this
provision of the bill a single accidental, inadvertent infringement
will subject that entire plant to destruction, though the copyright
owner may not be damaged 50 cents.
</p>

<p>
Could anything be easier than for a malicious manufacturer to ruin
his competitor by entrapping him into the manufacture of a single
infringing roll and then bringing suit under this section and
destroying his establishment?
</p>

<p>
Your committee will not doubt that the writer of this section was
ignorant of this possibility, if it acquits him of being malicious
in the drafting of this provision.
</p>

<p>
<i>7. Section 4966&mdash;Public performance.</i>&mdash;Your committees have
not failed to notice the single provision of section 64 of the bill
which, "providing that all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with
are hereby repealed," makes exception of section 4966, and in
respect to that section provides that its provisions "are hereby
confirmed and continued in force, anything contrary in this act
notwithstanding."
</p>

<p>
The framers of this bill were more anxious than for anything else
that the monopoly of public performance given by section 4966
should in no respect be weakened, and although they have embodied
in this bill provisions in terms more stringent than those of that
section, fearing that these more stringent provisions might not be
constitutional, or that by some slip they might be found to leave a
loophole, they reversed the ordinary procedure, and, instead of
making the bill as a new act, repealing all inconsistent acts, they
make the section of the former act nullify the bill as to all
inconsistent features.
</p>

<p>
It will occur to the committee that this is an unscientific mode of
proceeding, and that the bill, when enacted into law, should be
clear and consistent within itself, and not subject to
nullification by its own terms in any respect.
</p>

<p>
But it is believed that section 4966 of the present statute has
been tacitly treated as meaning something which the legislature in
enacting it never intended, and that the provisions in the present
bill, developing into express terms that which has been tacitly
treated as involved in the terms of said section of the present
law, crystalizes into dangerous permanency a defect which would
have been eliminated from the present statute whenever the United
States courts had occasion to review it.
</p>

<p>
Protection for public performance is justifiable only in respect to
compositions which by their nature yield no considerable revenue to
the author by the sale of copies or otherwise than by public
performance. Dramatic compositions clearly fall within this class.
A dramatic composition is written primarily to be performed and
only incidentally to be read. Some dramatic compositions may have
such literary character that they would be bought to be read and so
little dramatic quality that they will not be largely performed;
but the dramatic composition whose value is in performance and not
in reading gets little protection from the copyright statute
without special provision giving monopoly of public performance. A
hundred copies will supply all the actors who need it; no one else
wants it; but a million people will be glad to see it performed and
will pay high prices for their seats. The dramatic writer must get
his revenue from the million&mdash;not from the hundred&mdash;or he will fail
of adequate compensation.
</p>

<p>
Recognizing this situation, Congress, in 1870, enacted the
following provision:
</p>

<p>
"<span class="sc">Sec. 4966.</span> Any person publicly performing or representing
any dramatic composition for which copyright has been obtained,
without the consent of the proprietor or his heirs or assigns,
shall be liable," etc.
</p>

<p>
In 1897 the section was amended by inserting the provisions now
contained in section 4966, making it include musical compositions,
the words "or musical" being inserted after the word "dramatic" in
the second line of above.
</p>

<p>
There can be no reasonable doubt that the intention of the
amendment of this section, by making it refer also to musical
compositions, was to include musical-dramatic with other simple
dramatic compositions; that is, to make the scope of the protection
take in all compositions whose value rested in dramatic performance
as distinguished from mere vocalization.
</p>

<p>
The word "perform" in the section clearly points to this
significance and intention.
</p>

<p>
It is not believable that Congress intended to provide by this
amendment that every member of a religious congregation joining
publicly in the singing of a copyrighted tune should be liable to
the penalties prescribed by this section; nor even that every
member of a church choir, having purchased the copies of the
copyrighted anthem, sold only for such purpose and useful only for
such use, should be subject to these penalties, if the publisher
omitted to grant expressly the permission to sing with the sale of
a printed copy.
</p>

<p>
But no other interpretation can possibly be derived from the
present section unless the word "perform" is taken as applying to
dramatic performance and as not including mere vocalization in
public.
</p>

<p>
The present bill is intended to leave no doubt upon this point, and
in that respect it is contrary to public policy, sound sense, and
every consideration of justice.
</p>

<p>
The holder of a musical copyright should not be vested, by virtue
of that copyright, with the right to sell his music, which is made
to be sung, and prohibit its singing; to sell his music, which is
made to be played, and prohibit its playing. Still more obnoxious
to justice is it that one who has been openly sold a copy of a
piece of music, and who has done with it that which constitutes the
only motive for buying it, namely, has sung it, or played it, or
procured some one else to sing it for his entertainment, should, if
he chances to do that in public, be penalized and put in the
position of one who has committed a misdemeanor or transgressed
another's rights. Reason and sense revolt at such a statute or such
an interpretation of a statute; and musical composers demanding
such rights place themselves in contempt of civilized society.
</p>

<p>
Section 4966 should be amended by making clear that it relates only
to dramatic performance, while it includes such performance of
compositions which are musical as well as dramatic. And all
provisions of the present bill exceeding such protection should be
limited.
</p>

<p>
<i>8. As to right of translation.</i>&mdash;The present bill makes a
radical departure from the present statute in respect to the right
of translation of a copyrighted work into other languages. Under
the present statute, as above noted and presented in the brief
cited, the right of translation inheres in the author as author,
conditioned only upon copyright having been obtained of his
original work, but not conditioned upon that copyright remaining in
him. His assignment of the original copyright does not carry to the
purchaser, or divest from the author, the right of translation. The
translation, when made by the author, is his own product. He may
copyright it or not as he pleases; but the owner of the original
copyright has no right in the translation unless expressly conveyed
to him (which may be done, of course, by express mention in the
conveyance of the original copyright, or by the transference of the
manuscript of the original work before copyright, putting the
purchaser in the position fully of the author as to all the rights
arising out of authorship).
</p>

<p>
The present bill, however, makes the right of translation not
merely one which is conditioned upon the existence of copyright of
the original work, but an essential and integral part of that
copyright, so that it will pass with the assignment of the
copyright without special mention, and the proprietor of the
copyright, and not the author, would thereafter have the right of
translation. The author could not translate his own work without
infringing the copyright which he had sold to the proprietor. Any
translation, however maladroit or misleading, which the copyright
owner&mdash;publisher&mdash;might approve would pass under the author's name
as his work into the foreign language, and he would have no voice
to protest against the libel, no power to remedy the injury by
putting out a correct translation.
</p>

<p>
It can not be doubted that such considerations as these governed in
the enactment of the present statute in such form that the right of
translation inheres in the author and does not pass without his
express act, though the original copyright may have been assigned.
It is obvious that the author ought to have a right in respect to
translation which will not require express reservation in order to
remain his own when he sells his copyright. It will be apparent
that negotiations between an author and publisher for the sale of
his copyright will commonly proceed in general terms, referring to
the copyright by that term, and that the author will commonly be
considering only what may be termed the original copyright in such
negotiations, and that he will in some instances convey the
copyright with no thought of the appurtenant rights involved in it,
and will wake up only too late to find that he has no control over
translation, if the term "copyright" carries the whole right,
including that of translation, as the present bill provides.
</p>

<p>
The statute is right as it stands and the bill should be amended to
conform to the present statute in this respect.
</p>

<p>
I have drafted amendments to the various sections and paragraphs of
the bill such as are necessary, in my judgment, to make it conform
with the requirements of equity to the different interests
affected, and with sound public policy, in the various respects
above pointed out and discussed, and would submit them herewith,
but find that they are so numerous and require insertions and
emendations at so many points in the bill that I believe the
purposes of the committee will be much better served by the
submission a little later of a full draft of a bill embodying the
various changes which I would suggest, so that the matter may be
considered in a form consistent throughout instead of in the
piecemeal form which would result from the many amendments which
would be required to put the present bill in desirable form.
</p>

<p>
Such completely framed bill I promise to submit to the committee at
an early day and in ample time for full consideration upon the
reassembling of the committee in the fall.
</p>

<p>
Thanking the committee for the opportunity which has been afforded
me for presenting my views in the interest of my client, I am,
</p>

<p class="ctr">
STATEMENT OF NATHAN BURKAN, ESQ., OF NEW YORK CITY.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Gentlemen, there has been a great deal said here
about this "monopoly," this great "music trust," that intends to&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. You are a publisher, are you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. I represent the Music Publishers' Association.
This combination between the Music Publishers' Association and the
Æolian Company, the purpose of which is to destroy the independent
manufacturers of perforated rolls, cylinders, and disks adapted to
reproduce musical sounds.
</p>

<p>
I think we should at this time refer to the history of this alleged
contract between Æolian Company and some of the publishers. A number of
years ago an action was brought in the circuit court of Massachusetts
to restrain the manufacture and sale of perforated rolls on the ground
that such perforated rolls infringed the complainant's copyright on his
musical composition. The case was argued before Judge Colt, and he
decided that a perforated roll was not a copy of a sheet of music, and
therefore not an infringement of the copyright. (Kennedy <i>v.</i>
McTammany, 33 Fed. Rep., 584.) A number of years thereafter another
action was begun in the District of Columbia, the case of Stern
<i>v.</i> Rosey, to restrain the manufacture of cylinders and disks
adapted to reproduce musical sounds&mdash;applying particularly to talking
machines. That court decided against the publisher. Thereafter these
companies grew up, one after another, and manufactured rolls, disks,
and cylinders, and appropriated for use upon these devices the property
of the composer, for which he did not receive a dollar.
</p>

<p>
The Æolian Company, the pioneer in this line of industry, became a very
large concern, investing millions of dollars in the establishment of a
plant and in the manufacture of these rolls. They knew, or were advised
by counsel, that this question, whether a perforated roll adapted to
reproduce a copyrighted musical composition was not a "copy" of the
composition within the meaning of the copyright law, was uncertain; it
had never been decided by any appellate court. And it was very
essential for the welfare of the company, and for the protection of its
interests, to ascertain whether in fact it was infringing upon a
copyright every time it made or sold a roll.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. Do you represent the Æolian Company?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. No, sir; I do not. I have no interest in the
Æolian Company. I never appeared in any action for it, am not appearing
for it now, and do not expect and will not receive or accept any
compensation for my services here. I represent the music publishers,
and I am a friend of Mr. Victor Herbert.
</p>

<p>
I desire to reiterate that the Æolian Company was advised by able
counsel that there was some doubt about this proposition. The Æolian
Company, to protect its property, and in order to settle this question
once for all, sent its agents to several publishers who stated to them:
"Gentlemen, we have sought legal counsel&mdash;the ablest that we could find
in the city of New York&mdash;who advise us that there is grave doubt as to
whether the manufacture by us of these perforated sheets do not
infringe your copyrights, and that question ought to be determined by
the highest court or the land."
</p>

<p>
No single publisher, gentlemen, had sufficient funds to carry on such
an expensive litigation, because these music publishers are not the
millionaires that our friends on the other side have attempted to point
out and show. Most of them are poor men. No single composer would be
able to supply the funds to carry on such a litigation. There was a
great deal involved; and when this company came and said: "Gentlemen,
we will take up this litigation; we will try to establish your rights;
but for our trouble, if we do establish your rights, if we can get the
highest court in the land to decide that the present copyright laws are
applicable to these perforated sheets, then we want the exclusive
rights to manufacture perforated rolls adapted to reproduce your music
upon specified royalties for a number of years."
</p>

<p>
Was there anything inherently wrong in that? A number of publishers
naturally jumped at that offer. It would mean to a large publisher
thousands of dollars if the courts decided in his favor. At the time
when this offer was made, the perforated roll companies were
appropriating his copyrighted music for which he received not a single
penny. And the contract that was entered into between the Æolian
Company and some of the publishers, a copy of which was offered in
evidence here, provides that the consideration for this agreement was
this litigation. Nothing was concealed; everything in connection with
this contract was done in the open, and the consideration for the
contract is expressed in the contract as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
And for and in consideration of the premises the Æolian Company
hereby covenants and agrees to pay all proper expenses of
conducting such suit for the purpose of testing the applicability
of the United States copyright laws to perforated music sheets of
kinds aforesaid, and that if the court of last resort shall in such
suit decide that the United States copyright laws are applicable to
such perforated music sheets, then and in such, case and from that
time forward the Æolian Company will keep the books of account and
pay the royalties.
</p>
</div>

<p>
These gentlemen, the publishers who made this contract, did not have in
mind the creation of a monopoly. Each publisher, naturally, as any
other business man, wanted to get something for his property, and it
was very advantageous to the publisher to get the highest court to
decide in his favor, without paying the enormous expense of such a
litigation. Mr. Davis, the inventor of these perforated rolls, properly
said&mdash;he said it truthfully and honestly&mdash;"My invention depends upon
Mr. Sousa and Mr. Herbert and their compositions." The music of these
gentlemen is a component part of my invention.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. The Æolian Company, as the law stood, did
not have to pay to musical publishers a cent?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Not a cent.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. What was their object in getting a
decision of the court which would force them to pay large sums to the
musical publishers?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. They are the largest manufacturers of these rolls
in the world. They have manufactured thousands and thousands of these
rolls representing the best copyrighted compositions. Suppose a large
number of publishers or a number of public-spirited men had gotten
together a fund, and suppose a case to test the applicability of the
present copyright laws to perforated rolls had been carried to the
highest court and won&mdash;then the Æolian Company would have been obliged
to account for all its profits on these perforated rolls to the
publisher, and would have been obliged to pay Mr. Herbert, Mr. Sousa,
Mr. Chadwick, Mr. Damrosch, and other composers thousands of dollars in
back royalties; whereas under this agreement the Æolian Company
protected itself, because the publisher who signed it consented to the
use of his composition for the perforated rolls, and he would have been
estopped under such agreement from suing for an accounting of profits.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. Yes; but the Æolian Company originated
this litigation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Yes&mdash;very true, sir; very true. The Æolian Company
(and I do not appear in this matter as its champion at all) had spent
thousands of dollars to improve and protect its patents to these
perforated rolls. It employs the most skillful and talented arrangers
to arrange and edit these compositions embodied in the roll, so that
when you purchase an Æolian record or roll and pay your $2.50, or
whatever the price may be, you get a roll when used in connection with
the playing instrument which gives an exact reproduction of the music
as written by the composer, say, by Mr. Nevins, Mr. Chadwick, or Mr.
Foote. There were a small number of companies that also sold perforated
rolls, but instead of the rolls producing exact reproductions of the
music they gave distorted and feeble imitations or versions of that
music. They did not give to the public what the public was bargaining
for, and instead of creating a taste and demand for this form of
reproduction of music, the tendency was to destroy the taste and lessen
the demand; and the result was not only to destroy this great industry,
of which the Æolian Company was the pioneer and in which it was vitally
interested, but also to injure the composer whose work was thus
reproduced.
</p>

<p>
There is an artistic side to this question, sir. If you made a speech
in Congress, Mr. Chairman, and I should get someone else to repeat your
speech into a machine, and your speech lasted fifteen minutes, but in
order to crowd it into a cylinder that is adapted to reproduce a speech
of two minutes' duration, I should cut, distort, and disfigure it, and
then it was reproduced to the public all over the land and sold as Mr.
Currier's speech, you naturally would be offended. That is the artistic
side of this case.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. You would have no right to represent it as his
voice, his work.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. That is what they are doing&mdash;representing it as
his, the composer's work, and Mr. Herbert's work is judged by the
reproduction of it by these mechanical devices. The public says, "That
is Victor Herbert's composition," or "That is Mr. Chadwick's
composition." And I want to say to the gentlemen here that this
proposed law does not only cover music, but it covers poems, speeches,
and stories.
</p>

<p>
Now, then, some of these men made this contract. This contract is
solely dependent upon the decision of the Supreme Court. It is not
dependent upon any legislation at all, and the Æolian Company took
absolutely no part in this legislation. The Music Publishers'
Association received an invitation from Mr. Putnam to appear at the
conferences, and we appeared, and we naturally were interested in
getting this legislation. But I say this&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I interrupt one moment?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. May I deny that?
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. You will suspend.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. The Æolian Company took absolutely no part, had
nothing whatever to do with this legislation at all. And I say to you,
sir, that if the purpose of these contracts is to stifle competition
and to control the industry of making perforated rolls and
talking-machine cylinders, then the Sherman Act covers contracts of
this kind. I say to you that the Donnelly Act or antitrust law in our
State (New York) is very stringent; if it should appear to Mr. Jerome
or to the attorney-general of New York, in which State the Æolian
Company has its principal place of business, that these contracts tend
to stifle trade, or were entered into to destroy competition, each one
of these conspirators could be sent to jail, and could be restrained by
injunction from enforcing the contracts. We have antitrust laws, sir;
and under those laws each of these men could be restrained by
injunction from enforcing the contract and criminally punished for
entering into it.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. Your time has expired. Mr. Cromelin, you
may have one minute to contradict any statement he has made.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Mr. Chairman, just one minute. Just before
leaving New York Saturday I spoke with the manager of the Æolian
Company, and I wish this to go on record&mdash;that he told me that they did
not want to oppose this legislation; that they had contracts; and when
people have contracts of this kind they do not go to the house tops and
proclaim the fact. The only reason you know of this contract, sir, is
because it is a matter of record in the case of the Apollo Company in
the second circuit of New York.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Do you mean to say that this contract is an
improper one to make?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. Not at all; I did not say that, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Chaney</span>. Then what concern is it to us, who are engaged in
framing this bill, about that contract?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. The chairman asked the gentleman whether the
Æolian Company was interested in this&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Absolutely not.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Cromelin</span>. And the manager of the company told me that they
were.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. It might occur to some members of this
committee that if one concern was to get an absolute monopoly of making
perforated rolls or musical disks, it did concern this committee.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Can I say a word, sir, on that point? There are
hundreds of publishers, sir&mdash;hundreds of publishers who are under no
contract with the Æolian Company; there are hundreds of composers who
are under no contract with this company. You are legislating for the
future, and it seems unfair that hundreds of publishers and composers,
not parties to this agreement, should be punished because a number of
publishers, 10 or 20, have made an unlawful agreement. That is the
question that you must consider in connection with this "monopoly"
charge.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. Now, you are a lawyer?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Webb</span>. May I ask you your opinion as to whether or not the
word "writings," referred to in article 8 of the Constitution covers
these rolls?
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. Yes, sir; yes, sir. If you will just allow me
three minutes&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <span class="sc">Acting Chairman</span>. No; answer the question. I can not allow
you three minutes, because we shall have to go over to the House. The
hearings will be closed right here, as soon as you answer that
question.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Burkan</span>. In the circuit court of appeals, White-Smith
Company <i>v.</i> Apollo Company case, the court said in a decision
involving the question as to whether a perforated roll is an
infringement of the copyrighted work which it is adapted to reproduce,
and it is important in connection with the claim that Congress has no
power to enact this legislation&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The questions raised in these cases are of vast importance and
involve far-reaching results. They have been exhaustively discussed
in the clear and forcible briefs and arguments of counsel. We are
of the opinion that the rights sought to be protected by these
suits belong to the same class as those covered by the specific
provisions of the copyright statutes, and that the reasons which
led to the passage of said statutes apply with great force to the
protection of rights of copyright against such an appropriation of
the fruits of an author's conception as results from the acts of
defendant.
</p>

<p>
This language of the court is in itself, without further argument on
the definition of the word "writings," sufficient warrant and authority
for the Congress to enact this legislation.
</p>

<p>
(The hearings were thereupon announced closed.)
